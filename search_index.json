Datasets\nlongitudinal\nmain_summary\ncross_sectional\nclient_count\n\n\nCrash Ping Derived Datasets\ncrash_aggregates\n\n\nAppendix\nMobile Metrics\n\n\n\n\nRaw Pings\nWe receive data from our users via pings.\nThere are several types of pings,\neach containing different measurements and sent for different purposes.\nTo review a complete list of ping types and their schemata, see \nthis section of the Mozilla Source Tree Docs.\nBackground and Caveats\nThe large majority of analyses can be completed using only the\nmain ping.\nThis ping includes histograms, scalars, and other performance and diagnostic data.\nFew analyses actually rely directly on the raw ping data.\nInstead, we provide derived datasets which are processed versions of these data,\nmade to be:\n\nEasier and faster to query\nOrganized to make the data easier to analyze\nCleaned of erroneous or misleading data\n\nBefore analyzing raw ping data,\ncheck to make sure there isn't already a derived dataset made for your purpose.\nIf you do need to work with raw ping data, be aware that loading the data can take a while.\nTry to limit the size of your data by controlling the date range, etc.\nAccessing the Data\nYou can access raw ping data from an \nATMO cluster using the \nDataset API.\nRaw ping data are not available in re:dash.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find the complete ping documentation.\nTo augment our data collection, see\nCollecting New Data\nMain Ping Derived Datasets\nThe main ping\ncontains most of the measurements used to track performance and health of Firefox in the wild.\nThis ping includes histograms and scalars.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\nlongitudinal\nThe longitudinal dataset is a 1% sample of main ping data\norganized so that each row corresponds to a client_id.\nIf you're not sure which dataset to use for your analysis,\nthis is probably what you want.\nContents\nEach row in the longitudinal dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column represents a field from the main ping.\nMost fields contain arrays of values, with one value for each ping associated with a client_id.\nUsing arrays give you access to the raw data from each ping,\nbut can be difficult to work with from SQL.\nHere's a query showing some sample data\nto help illustrate.\nTake a look at the longitudinal examples if you get stuck.\nBackground and Caveats\nThink of the longitudinal table as wide and short.\nThe dataset contains more columns than main_summary\nand down-samples to 1% of all clients to reduce query computation time and save resources.\nIn summary, the longitudinal table differs from main_summary in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data so that one row represents a client_id\nThe longitudinal dataset samples to 1% of all client_ids\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe longitudinal is available in re:dash,\nthough it can be difficult to work with the array values in SQL.\nTake a look at this example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data\nin Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/longitudinal/\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for the longitudinal dataset is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nWe also have a set of examples in the longitudinal cookbook\nThe code that generates this dataset is here\nmain_summary\nThe main_summary table is the most direct representation of a main ping\nbut can be difficult to work with due to its size. \nPrefer the longitudinal dataset unless using the sampled data is prohibitive.\nContents\nThe main_summary table contains one row for each ping.\nEach column represents one

example, the longitudinal table has a row called geo_country \nwhich contains an array of country codes.\nFor the same client_id the cross_sectional table \nhas columns called geo_country_mode and geo_country_configs \ncontaining single summary statistics for \nthe modal country and the number of distinct countries in the

Gotchas","keywords":"","body":"Analysis Gotchas\nWhen performing analysis on any data there are some mistakes that are easy to make and details that are easy to overlook. Do you know exactly what question you hope to answer? Is your sample representative of your population? Is your result \"real\"? How precisely can you state your conclusion?\nThis document is not about those traps. Instead, it is about quirks and pitfalls specific to Telemetry.\nPseudo-replication\nTelemetry data is a collection of pings. A single main-ping represents a single subsession. Some clients have more subsessions than others.\nSo when you say \"63% of beta 53 has Firefox set as its default browser\", make sure you specify it is 63% of pings, since it is only around 46% of clients. (Apparently users with Firefox Beta 53 set as their default browser submit more main-pings than users who don't).\nProfiles vs Users\nIn the section above you'll notice I said \"clients\" not \"users.\" That is because of all the things we're able to count, users isn't one of them.\nUsers can have multiple Firefox profiles running on the same computer at the same time (like developers).\nUsers can have the same Firefox profile running on several computers on different days of the week (also developers).\nThe only things we can count are pings and clients. Clients we can count because we send a client_id with each ping that uniquely identifies the profile from which it came. This is generally close enough to our idea of \"user\" that we can get away with counting profiles and calling them users, but you may run into some instances where the distinction matters.\nWhen in doubt, be precise. You're counting clients.\nOpt-in vs Opt-out\nWe don't collect the same information from everyone.\nEvery profile that doesn't have Telemetry disabled sends us \"opt-out\" Telemetry. This includes:\n\nNearly everything in the Environment\nSome very specific Histograms, Scalars, and Events that are marked \"releaseChannelCollection\": \"opt-out\"\n\nMost probes are \"opt-in\": we do not get information from them unless the user opts into sending us this information. Users can opt-in in two ways:\n\nUsing Firefox's Options UI to tick the box that gives us permission\nInstalling any pre-release version of Firefox\n\nThe nature of selection bias is such that the population in #1 is useless for analysis. If you want to encourage users to collect good information for us, ask them to install Beta: it's only slightly harder than finding and checking the opt-in checkbox in Firefox.\nTrusting Dates\nDon't trust client times.\nAny timestamp recorded by the user is subject to \"clock skew.\" The user's clock can be set (purposefully or accidentally) to any time at all. The nature of SSL certificates tends to keep this within a certain relatively-accurate window, because a user who's clock is too far in the past or too far in the future might confuse certain expiration-date-checking code.\nExamples of client times: crashDate, crashTime, meta/Date, sessionStartDate, subsessionStartDate, profile/creationDate\nExamples of server times you can trust: Timestamp\nDate Formats\nNot all dates and times are created equal. Most of the dates and times in Telemetry pings are ISO 8601. Most are full timestamps, though their resolution may differ from being per-second to being per-day.\nThen there's profile/creationDate which is just a number of days since epoch. Like 17177 for the date 2017-01-11.\nTip: To convert profile/creationDate to a usable date in SQL: DATE_ADD('day', profile_created, DATE '1970-01-01')\nIn derived datasets ISO dates are sometimes converted to strings in one of two formats: %Y-%m-%d or %Y%m%d.\nBuild ids look like dates but aren't. If you take the first eight characters you can use that as a proxy for the day the build was released.\nDelays\nTelemetry data takes a while to get into our hands. The largest data mule in Telemetry is the main-ping. It is (pending bug 1336360) sent at the beginning of a client's next Firefox session. If the user shuts down their Firefox for the weekend, we won't get their Friday data until Monday morning.\nA rule of thumb (pending bug 1336360) is data from two days ago is usually fairly representative.\nIf you'd like to read more about this subject and look at pretty graphs, there are a series of blogposts here.\n"},"concepts/review.html":{"url":"concepts/review.html","title":"Getting Review","keywords":"","body":"Work in Progress\nThis article is a work in progress.\nThe work is being tracked in\nthis bug\n"},"datasets/":{"url":"datasets/","title":"Data Collection and Datasets","keywords":"","body":"Datasets and Data Collection\n\nAfter completing Choosing A Dataset,\nyou should have a high level understanding of what questions each dataset is able to answer.\nThis section contains a series of tutorials which will help you understand our dataset more deeply.\n\n\nReading this section front to back is not recommended.\nInstead, identify a dataset you’d like to understand better and read through\nthe relavent documentation.\n"},"tools/experiments.html":{"url":"tools/experiments.html","title":"Tools for Experimentation","keywords":"","body":"Work in Progress\nThis article is a work in progress.\nThe work is being tracked in\nthis bug.\nGuide to our Experimental Tools\n"},"datasets/reference.html":{"url":"datasets/reference.html","title":"Dataset Reference","keywords":"","body":"Dataset Reference\nThis section contains tutorials that focus on a single dataset each.\nAfter reading the tutorial, you should know all you need about the dataset.\nEach tutorial should include:\n\nA short overview of why we built the dataset and what need it's meant to solve\nAn example query to give the reader an idea of what the data looks like\nand how it is meant to be used\nWhat datasource the data is collected from\nHow frequently it's updated\nHow it is processed and sampled\nHow it is stored and how to access the data including\nwhether the data is available in re:dash\ns3 paths\nsnippets for loading the parquet tables with spark\n\n\nHow to augment or modify the dataset\n\n"},"datasets/pings.html":{"url":"datasets/pings.html","title":"Pings","keywords":"","body":"Work in Progress\nThis article is a work in progress.\nThe work is being tracked in\nthis bug.\nCoverage\nWhy look at pings?\nWhat types of data do we have?\nOpt In vs Opt Out\nHow to look at pings\n"},"datasets/derived.html":{"url":"datasets/derived.html","title":"Derived Datasets","keywords":"","body":"Derived Datasets\nSee Choosing a Dataset\nfor a discussion on the differences between pings and derived datasets.\n"},"datasets/batch_view/Longitudinal.html":{"url":"datasets/batch_view/Longitudinal.html","title":"Longitudinal","keywords":"","body":"The Longitudinal Derived Stream\nThe longitudinal dataset is generated by src/main/scala/com/mozilla/telemetry/views/Longitudinal.scala. It's useful for running fast queries on common fields in pings, such as user OSs, channels, and settings.\nThe resulting dataset can be retrieved as a DataFrame, which can be thought of as a distributed array of map of arrays:\n\nThe outer array (which is actually a DataFrame) contains one element per client (clients are distinguished by the clientId top-level field in pings).\nEach element of that outer array is a map, where fields are the ones defined in src/main/scala/streams/Longitudinal.scala in the buildSchema function. Remember that the map represents a single client.\nWhenever records are converted from JSON, JSON keys are converted from camelCase (in the original ping) into snake_case (in the resulting dataset) by src/main/scala/com/mozilla/telemetry/avro/JSON2Avro.scala.\nFor example, the firstPaint simple measure in a ping object like (payload.simpleMeasurements -> {\"firstPaint\":2114,...other simple measurements...},...other fields..) shows up under first_paint in the resulting dataset.\nThe buildRecord function in src/main/scala/com/mozilla/telemetry/views/Longitudinal.scala defines exactly how fields in the pings map to fields in the schema.\n\n\nMost values in the map are themselves arrays, where elements are the values of that field in the payloads sent by that client.\nFor example, the geo_country field will be an array of string country codes, representing the geoCountry top-level field in each of the pings sent by that client.\nCertain fields, like client_id (representing clientId in the original pings) are not arrays, because they are always the same for a given client.\n\n\nThe dots . in the scalar probe names are replaced with underscores _. Moreover, to prevent name collisions between scalars and histograms, scalars are prefixed with scalar_. The name of the process generating the data immediately follows the prefix. For example, the test.group.probe_name scalar probe, set from the parent process, can be looked up as scalar_parent_test_group_probe_name.\n\nNote that the pings seen by the code are not exactly the raw pings you see in the Gecko docs. Instead, they're the output of the data pipeline. An example of one of these pings can be found here.\nAppendix\nThis documentation is taken from the telemetry-batch-view documentation\n"},"datasets/batch_view/cross_sectional.html":{"url":"datasets/batch_view/cross_sectional.html","title":"Cross Sectional","keywords":"","body":"Work in Progress\nThis article is still a work in progress.\nThe work is being tracked in\nthis bug\n"},"datasets/batch_view/MainSummary.html":{"url":"datasets/batch_view/MainSummary.html","title":"Main Summary","keywords":"","body":"The Main Summary dataset\nThe Main Summary dataset is generated by src/main/scala/com/mozilla/telemetry/views/MainSummaryView.scala. It contains one record for every main ping submitted by Desktop Firefox.\nMore specifically, for a given day D, it contains one record for each Telemetry record on S3 starting with a prefix of $D/telemetry/4/main/Firefox, as long as the record contains a non-null value for documentId, submissionDate, and Timestamp. We do not ever expect nulls for these fields.\nNo attempt is made to de-duplicate submissions by documentId, so any analysis that could be affected by duplicate records should take care to remove duplicates using the documentId field.\nGenerating the dataset\nFor distributed execution, we can build a self-contained JAR file, then run it with Spark.\nFor example, to generate the main_summary dataset for April 12, 2016 to April 28, 2016,\nand storing the resulting data in an s3 bucket called example_bucket:\nsbt assembly\nspark-submit \\\n    --master yarn \\\n    --deploy-mode client \\\n    --class com.mozilla.telemetry.views.MainSummaryView \\\n    telemetry-batch-view-1.1.jar \\\n    --bucket example_bucket \\\n    --from 20160412 \\\n    --to 20160428\n\nNotes:\n\nThis dataset is updated daily via the telemetry-airflow infrastructure.\nThe job DAG runs every day shortly after midnight UTC.\nThe job saves the resulting data to S3 as Parquet-serialized DataFrames, under prefixes of the form main_summary/v3/submission_date_s3=(YYYYMMDD SUBMISSION DATE)/sample_id=(INT VALUE) in the telemetry-parquet bucket.\nEach of these prefixes is a partition. There is a partition for each submissionDate + sampleId. Records without a clientId will not have a sampleId either, and will end up with a sampleid partition of `_HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION`.\nThe Main Summary data can be accessed from Spark via clusters launched at analysis.telemetry.mozilla.org or via Presto at sql.telemetry.mozillla.org.

few notable exceptions:\n\nThe search_count field is an array of structs, each item in the array representing\na 3-tuple of (engine, source, count). The engine field represents the name of\nthe search engine against which the searches were done. The source field represents\nthe part of the Firefox UI that was used to perform the search. It contains values\nsuch as \"abouthome\", \"urlbar\", and \"searchbar\". The count field contains the number\nof searches performed against this engine+source combination during that subsession.\nAny of the fields in the struct may be null (for example if the search key did not\nmatch the expected pattern, or if the count was non-numeric).\nThe loop_activity_counter field is a simple struct containing inner fields for each\nexpected value of the LOOP_ACTIVITY_COUNTER Enumerated Histogram. Each inner field\nis a count for that histogram bucket.\nThe popup_notification_stats field is a map of String keys to struct values,\neach field in the struct being a count for the expected values of the\nPOPUP_NOTIFICATION_STATS Keyed Enumerated Histogram.\nThe places_bookmarks_count and places_pages_count fields contain the mean\nvalue of the corresponding Histogram, which can be interpreted as the average number\nof bookmarks or pages in a given subsession.\nThe active_addons field contains an array of structs, one for each entry in\nthe environment.addons.activeAddons section of the payload. More detail in\nBug 1290181.\nThe theme field contains a single struct in the same shape as the items in the\nactive_addons array.

It contains stats used for computing crash rates and other stability-related metrics, aggregated by a variety of criteria.\nEssentially, each row of the view represents the stats for a particular population. For example, one row might represent crash stats and usage hours for pings from Firefox Beta 46 on 64-bit Windows 7, and so on.\nTo generate the dataset for April 10, 2016 to April 11, 2016:\nsbt \"run-main com.mozilla.telemetry.views.CrashAggregateView --from 20160410 --to 20160411 --bucket telemetry-bucket\"\n\nNote: Currently, due to avro-parquet issues, Parquet writing only works under the spark-submit commands - the above example will fail. This will be fixed when avro-parquet updates or is removed.\nFor distributed execution, we can build a self-contained JAR file, then run it with Spark. To generate the dataset for April 10, 2016 to April 11, 2016:\nsbt assembly\nspark-submit --master yarn-client --class com.mozilla.telemetry.views.CrashAggregateView target/scala-2.11/telemetry-batch-view-*.jar --from 20160410 --to 20160411 --bucket telemetry-bucket\n\nNotes:\n\nA Spark analysis runs daily using a scheduled analysis job.\nThe job, crash-aggregates, runs the run_crash_aggregator.ipynb Jupyter notebook, which downloads, installs, and runs the crash-rate-aggregates on the cluster.\nCurrently, this is running every day at midnight UTC on airflow. The job definition is publicly available on the telemetry-airflow repository\n\n\nThe job uploads the resulting data to S3 as Parquet-serialized DataFrames, under prefixes of the form crash-aggregates/v1/submission_date=(YYYY-MM-DD SUBMISSION DATE)/ in the telemetry-parquet bucket.\nEach of these prefixes is a partition. There is a partition for each submission date..\n\n\nWe have Presto set up to query the data on S3 using Presto's SQL query engine.\nCurrently, this instance is available at ec2-54-218-5-112.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com. The provisioning files for the Presto instance are available as well.\nAt the moment, new partitions must be imported using parquet2hive. There's a temporary cron job set up on the instance to do the importing, which will eventually be replaced with something better.\n\n\nThe re:dash setup connects to Presto and allows users to make SQL queries, build dashboards, etc. with the crash aggregates data.\n\nSchemas and Making Queries\nIn the re:dash interface, make a new query, and set the data source to \"Presto\" if it isn't already. Now, we can make queries against the crash_aggregates table, which contains all of our crash data.\nA query that computes crash rates for each channel (sorted by number of usage hours) would look like this:\nSELECT dimensions['channel'] AS channel,\n       sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS usage_hours,\n       1000 * sum(stats['main_crashes']) / sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS main_crash_rate,\n       1000 * sum(stats['content_crashes']) / sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS content_crash_rate,\n       1000 * sum(stats['plugin_crashes']) / sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS plugin_crash_rate,\n       1000 * sum(stats['gmplugin_crashes']) / sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS gmplugin_crash_rate,\n       1000 * sum(stats['gpu_crashes']) / sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS gpu_crash_rate\nFROM crash_aggregates\nGROUP BY dimensions['channel']\nORDER BY -sum(stats['usage_hours'])\n\nAn aggregate in this context is a combined collection of Telemetry pings. An aggregate for Windows 7 64-bit Firefox on March 15, 2016 represents the stats for all pings that originate from Windows 7 64-bit Firefox, on March 15, 2016. Aggregates represent all the pings that meet that aggregate's criteria. The subpopulations represented by individual aggregates are always disjoint.\nPresto has its own SQL engine, and therefore its own extensions to standard SQL. The SQL that Presto uses is documented here.\nThe crash_aggregates table has 4 commonly-used columns:\n\nsubmission_date is the date pings were submitted for a particular aggregate.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where submission_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by pings submitted on March 15, 2016.\nThe dataset is partitioned by this field. Queries that limit the possible values of submission_date can run significantly faster.\n\n\nactivity_date is the day when the activity being recorded took place.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where activity_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by activities that took place on March 15, 2016.\nThis can be several days before the pings are actually submitted, so it will always be before or on its corresponding submission_date.\nTherefore, queries that are sensitive to when measurements were taken on the client should prefer this field over submission_date.\n\n\ndimensions is a map of all the other dimensions that we currently care about. These fields include:\ndimensions['build_version'] is the program version, like 46.0a1.\ndimensions['build_id'] is the YYYYMMDDhhmmss timestamp the program was built, like 20160123180541. This is also known as the \"build ID\" or \"buildid\".\ndimensions['channel'] is the channel, like release or beta.\ndimensions['application'] is the program name, like Firefox or Fennec.\ndimensions['os_name'] is the name of the OS the program is running on, like Darwin or Windows_NT.\ndimensions['os_version'] is the version of the OS the program is running on.\ndimensions['architecture'] is the architecture that the program was built for (not necessarily the one it is running on).\ndimensions['country'] is the country code for the user (determined using geoIP), like US or UK.\ndimensions['experiment_id'] is the identifier of the experiment being participated in, such as e10s-beta46-noapz@experiments.mozilla.org, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['experiment_branch'] is the branch of the experiment being participated in, such as control or experiment, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['e10s_enabled'] is whether E10S is enabled.\ndimensions['e10s_cohort'] is the E10S cohort the user is part of, such as control, test, or disqualified.\ndimensions['gfx_compositor'] is the graphics backend compositor used by the program, such as d3d11, opengl and simple. Null values may be reported as none as well.\nAll of the above fields can potentially be blank, which means \"not present\". That means that in the actual pings, the corresponding fields were null.\n\n\nstats contains the aggregate values that we care about:\nstats['usage_hours'] is the number of user-hours represented by the aggregate.\nstats['main_crashes'] is the number of main process crashes represented by the aggregate (or just program crashes, in the non-E10S case).\nstats['content_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['plugin_crashes'] is the number of plugin process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['gmplugin_crashes'] is the number of Gecko media plugin (often abbreviated GMPlugin) process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['content_shutdown_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes that were caused by failure to shut down in a timely manner.\nstats['gpu_crashes'] is the number of gpu process crashes represented by the aggregate.\n\n\n\nPlugin process crashes per hour on Nightly for March 14:\nSELECT sum(stats['plugin_crashes'] / sum(stats->>'usage_hours') FROM aggregates\nWHERE dimensions->>'channel' = 'nightly' AND activity_date = '2016-03-14'\n\nMain process crashes by build date and E10S cohort.\nWITH channel_rates AS (\n  SELECT dimensions['build_id'] AS build_id,\n         SUM(stats['main_crashes']) AS main_crashes, -- total number of crashes\n         SUM(stats['usage_hours']) / 1000 AS usage_kilohours, -- thousand hours of usage\n         dimensions['e10s_cohort'] AS e10s_cohort -- e10s cohort\n   FROM crash_aggregates\n   WHERE dimensions['experiment_id'] is null -- not in an experiment\n     AND regexp_like(dimensions['build_id'], '^\\d{14}$') -- validate build IDs\n     AND dimensions['build_id'] > '20160201000000' -- only in the date range that we care about\n   GROUP BY dimensions['build_id'], dimensions['e10s_cohort']\n)\nSELECT cast(parse_datetime(build_id, 'yyyyMMddHHmmss') as date) as build_id, -- program build date\n       usage_kilohours, -- thousands of usage hours\n       e10s_cohort, -- e10s cohort\n       main_crashes / usage_kilohours AS main_crash_rate -- crash rate being defined as crashes per thousand usage hours\nFROM channel_rates\nWHERE usage_kilohours > 100 -- only aggregates that have statistically significant usage hours\nORDER BY build_id ASC\n\nTechnical Details\nWe ignore invalid pings in our processing. Invalid pings are defined as those that:\n\nThe submission dates or activity dates are invalid or missing.\nThe build ID is malformed.\nThe docType field is missing or unknown.\nThe ping is a main ping without usage hours or a crash ping with usage hours.\n\nAppendix\nThis documentation is taken from the telemetry-batch-view documentation\n"},"datasets/batch_view/Events.html":{"url":"datasets/batch_view/Events.html","title":"Events","keywords":"","body":"The Events dataset\nThe Events dataset is currently generated by src/main/scala/com/mozilla/telemetry/views/MainEventsView.scala for events in the main ping, but separate jobs for other ping types are planned for the near future.

If you're not sure which\ndataset to use for your query, this is probably what you want. It differs from\nthe main_summary table in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data for a client-id in the same row.\nThis makes it easy to report profile level metrics. Without this deduping,\nmetrics would be weighted by the number of submissions instead of by clients.\nThe dataset uses a 1% of all recent profiles, which will reduce query\ncomputation time and save resources. The sample of clients will be stable over\ntime.\n\nAccordingly, one should prefer using the Longitudinal dataset except in the\nrare case where a 100% sample is strictly necessary.\nAs discussed in the Longitudinal Data Set Example Notebook:\nThe longitudinal dataset is logically organized as a table where rows\nrepresent profiles and columns the various metrics (e.g. startup time). Each\nfield of the table contains a list of values, one per Telemetry submission\nreceived for that profile. [...]\n\nThe current version of the longitudinal dataset has been build with all\nmain pings received from 1% of profiles across all channels with [...] up to\n180 days of data.\nTable structure\nTo get an overview of the longitudinal data table:\nDESCRIBE longitudinal\n\nThat table has a row for each client, with columns for the different\nparts of the ping. There are a lot of fields here, so I recommend\ndownloading the results as a CSV if you want to search through these\nfields. Unfortunately, there's no way to filter the output of DESCRIBE\nin Presto.\nBecause this table combines all rows for a given client id, most columns\ncontain either Arrays or Maps (described below). A few properties are\ndirectly available to query on:\nSELECT count(*) AS count\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nArrays\nMost properties are arrays, which contain one entry for each submission\nfrom a given client (newest first). Note that indexing starts at 1:\nSELECT reason[1] AS newest_reason\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nTo expand arrays and maps and work on the data row-wise we can use\nUNNEST(array).\nWITH lengths AS\n  (SELECT os, greatest(-1, least(31, sl / (24*60*60))) AS days\n   FROM longitudinal\n   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(session_length, reason) AS t(sl, r)\n   WHERE r = 'shutdown' OR r = 'aborted-session')\nSELECT os, days, count(*) AS count\nFROM lengths\nGROUP BY days, os ORDER BY days ASC\n\nHowever, it may be better to use a sample from the main_summary table\ninstead.\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on array\nfunctions\nUNNEST\ndocumentation\n\nMaps\nSome fields like active_addons or user_prefs are handled as maps, on\nwhich you can use the [] operator and special functions:\nWITH adp AS\n  (SELECT active_addons[1]['{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}']\n            IS NOT null AS has_adblockplus\n   FROM longitudinal)\nSELECT has_adblockplus, count(*) AS count\nFROM adp GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on map\nfunctions\n\nSampling\nWhile composing queries, it can be helpful to work on small samples to\nreduce query runtimes:\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal LIMIT 1000 ...\n\nThere's no need to use other sampling methods, such as TABLESAMPLE, on\nthe longitudinal set. Rows are randomly ordered, so a LIMIT sample is\nexpected to be random.\nExample Queries\nBlocklist URLs (extensions.blocklist.url)\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).user_prefs['extensions.blocklist.url'] AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nBlocklist enabled/disabled (extensions.blocklist.enabled) count:\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).blocklist_enabled AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nParsing most recent submission_date\nSELECT DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z') as parsed_submission_date\nFROM longitudinal\n\nLimiting to most recent ping in the last 7 days\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal\nWHERE DATE_DIFF('day', DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z'), current_date) \nScalar measurement (how many users with more than 100 tabs)\nWITH samples AS\n (SELECT\n   client_id,\n   normalized_channel as channel,\n   mctc.value AS max_concurrent_tabs\n  FROM longitudinal\n  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count) as t (mctc)\n  WHERE\n   scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count is not null and\n   mctc.value is not null and\n   normalized_channel = 'nightly')\nSELECT approx_distinct(client_id) FROM samples WHERE max_concurrent_tabs > 100\n\nUsing Views\nIf you find yourself copy/pasting SQL between different queries,\nconsider using a Presto VIEW to allow for code reuse. Views create\nlogical tables which you can reuse in other queries. For example, this\nview defines some\nimportant filters and derived variables which are then used in this\ndownstream\nquery.\nYou can define a view by prefixing your query with\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS ...\n\nBe careful not to overwrite an existing view! Using a unique name is\nimportant.\nFind more information\nhere.\nWorking offline\nIt's often useful to keep a local sample of the l10l data when\nprototyping an analysis. The data is stored in\ns3://telemetry-parquet/longitudinal/. Once you have AWS credentials you\ncan copy a shard of the parquet dataset to a local directory using aws\ncp [filename] .\nTo request AWS credentials, see this\npage.\nTo initiate your AWS config, try aws configure\nFAQ\nI'm getting an error, \"... cannot be resolved\"\nFor some reason, re:dash has trouble parsing SQL strings with double\nquotes.
