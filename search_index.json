Datasets\ncrash_aggregates\ncrash_summary\n\n\nAppendix\nMobile Metrics\n\n\n\n\nRaw Pings\nWe receive data from our users via pings.\nThere are several types of pings,\neach containing different measurements and sent for different purposes.\nTo review a complete list of ping types and their schemata, see \nthis section of the Mozilla Source Tree Docs.\nBackground and Caveats\nThe large majority of analyses can be completed using only the\nmain ping.\nThis ping includes histograms, scalars, and other performance and diagnostic data.\nFew analyses actually rely directly on the raw ping data.\nInstead, we provide derived datasets which are processed versions of these data,\nmade to be:\n\nEasier and faster to query\nOrganized to make the data easier to analyze\nCleaned of erroneous or misleading data\n\nBefore analyzing raw ping data,\ncheck to make sure there isn't already a derived dataset made for your purpose.\nIf you do need to work with raw ping data, be aware that loading the data can take a while.\nTry to limit the size of your data by controlling the date range, etc.\nAccessing the Data\nYou can access raw ping data from an \nATMO cluster using the \nDataset API.\nRaw ping data are not available in re:dash.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find the complete ping documentation.\nTo augment our data collection, see\nCollecting New Data\nMain Ping Derived Datasets\nThe main ping\ncontains most of the measurements used to track performance and health of Firefox in the wild.\nThis ping includes histograms and scalars.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\nlongitudinal\nThe longitudinal dataset is a 1% sample of main ping data\norganized so that each row corresponds to a client_id.\nIf you're not sure which dataset to use for your analysis,\nthis is probably what you want.\nContents\nEach row in the longitudinal dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column represents a field from the main ping.\nMost fields contain arrays of values, with one value for each ping associated with a client_id.\nUsing arrays give you access to the raw data from each ping,\nbut can be difficult to work with from SQL.\nHere's a query showing some sample data\nto help illustrate.\nTake a look at the longitudinal examples if you get stuck.\nBackground and Caveats\nThink of the longitudinal table as wide and short.\nThe dataset contains more columns than main_summary\nand down-samples to 1% of all clients to reduce query computation time and save resources.\nIn summary, the longitudinal table differs from main_summary in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data so that one row represents a client_id\nThe longitudinal dataset samples to 1% of all client_ids\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe longitudinal is available in re:dash,\nthough it can be difficult to work with the array values in SQL.\nTake a look at this example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data\nin Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/longitudinal/\nmain_summary\nThe main_summary table is the most direct representation of a main ping\nbut can be difficult to work with due to its size. \nPrefer the longitudinal dataset unless using the sampled data is prohibitive.\nContents\nThe main_summary table contains one row for each ping.\nEach column represents one field from the main ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all main ping fields are included.\nThis dataset does not include histograms.\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is massive, and due to it's size, it can be difficult to work with.\nYou should avoid querying main_summary from re:dash.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash on a shared cluster.\nInstead, we recommend using the longitudinal or cross_sectional dataset where possible.\nIf these datasets do not suffice, consider using Spark on an\nATMO cluster.\nIn the odd case where these queries are necessary,\nmake use of the sample_id field and limit to a short submission date range.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/main_summary/v3/\nThough not recommended main_summary is accessible through re:dash. \nHere's an example query.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash is on a shared cluster.\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for main_summary is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is \nhere\ncross_sectional\nThe cross_sectional dataset provides descriptive statistics\nfor each client_id in a 1% sample of main ping data.\nThis dataset simplifies the longitudinal table by replacing \nthe longitudinal arrays with summary statistics. \nThis is the most useful dataset for describing our user base.\nContent\nEach row in the cross_sectional dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column is a summary statistic describing the client_id.\nFor example, the longitudinal table has a row called geo_country \nwhich contains an array of country codes.\nFor the same client_id the cross_sectional table \nhas columns called geo_country_mode and geo_country_configs \ncontaining single summary statistics for \nthe modal country and the number of distinct countries in the array.\n\n\n\nclient_id\ngeo_country\ngeo_country_mode\ngeo_country_configs\n\n\n\n\n1\narray\n\"US\"\n1\n\n\n2\narray\n\"DE\"\n2\n\n\n\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is much easier to work with than the longitudinal dataset because\nyou don't need to work with arrays.\nThis table has a limited number of pre-computed summary statistics\nso you're metric may not be included.\nNote that this dataset is a summary of the longitudinal dataset,\nso it is also a 1% sample of all client_ids.\nAll summary statistics are computed over the last 180 days,\nso this dataset can be insensitive to changes over time.\nAccessing the Data\nThe cross_sectional dataset is available in re:dash.\nHere's an example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/cross_sectional/v1/\nFurther Reading\nThe cross_sectional dataset is generated by \nthis code.\nTake a look at this query for a schema.\nclient_count\nThe client_count dataset is useful for estimating user counts over a few \npre-defined dimensions.\nContent\nThis dataset includes columns for a dozen factors and an HLL variable.\nThe hll column contains a\nHyperLogLog\nvariable, which is an approximation to the exact count.\nThe factor columns include activity date and the dimensions listed\nhere.\nEach row represents one combinations of the factor columns.\nBackground and Caveats\nIt's important to understand that the hll column is not a standard count.\nThe hll variable avoids double-counting users when aggregating over multiple days.\nThe HyperLogLog variable is a far more efficient way to count distinct elements of a set,\nbut comes with some complexity.\nTo find the cardinality of an HLL use cardinality(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nTo find the union of two HLL's over different dates, use merge(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nThe Firefox ER Reporting Query\nis a good example to review.\nFinally, Roberto has a relevant writeup\nhere.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is available in re:dash.\nTake a look at this \nexample query.\nI don't recommend accessing this data from ATMO.\nFurther Reading\nCrash Ping Derived Datasets\nThe crash ping\nis captured after the main Firefox process crashes or after a content process crashes,\nwhether or not the crash report is submitted to crash-stats.mozilla.org.\nIt includes non-identifying metadata about the crash.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\ncrash_aggregates\nThe crash_aggregates dataset compiles crash statistics over various dimensions for each day.\nRows and Columns\nThere's one column for each of the stratifying dimensions and the crash statistics.\nEach row is a distinct set of dimensions, along with their associated crash stats.\nExample stratifying dimensions include channel and country,\nexample statistics include usage hours and plugin crashes.\nSee the complete documentation\nfor all available dimensions\nand statistics.\nAccessing the Data\nThis dataset is accessible via re:dash.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/crash_aggregates/v1/\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for this dataset can be found in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation\ncrash_summary\nThe crash_summary table is the most direct representation of a crash ping.\nContents\nThe crash_summary table contains one row for each crash ping.\nEach column represents one field from the crash ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all crash ping fields are included.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following

Gotchas","keywords":"","body":"Analysis Gotchas\nWhen performing analysis on any data there are some mistakes that are easy to make and details that are easy to overlook. Do you know exactly what question you hope to answer? Is your sample representative of your population? Is your result \"real\"? How precisely can you state your conclusion?\nThis document is not about those traps. Instead, it is about quirks and pitfalls specific to Telemetry.\nPseudo-replication\nTelemetry data is a collection of pings. A single main-ping represents a single subsession. Some clients have more subsessions than others.\nSo when you say \"63% of beta 53 has Firefox set as its default browser\", make sure you specify it is 63% of pings, since it is only around 46% of clients. (Apparently users with Firefox Beta 53 set as their default browser submit more main-pings than users who don't).\nProfiles vs Users\nIn the section above you'll notice I said \"clients\" not \"users.\" That is because of all the things we're able to count, users isn't one of them.\nUsers can have multiple Firefox profiles running on the same computer at the same time (like developers).\nUsers can have the same Firefox profile running on several computers on different days of the week (also developers).\nThe only things we can count are pings and clients. Clients we can count because we send a client_id with each ping that uniquely identifies the profile from which it came. This is generally close enough to our idea of \"user\" that we can get away with counting profiles and calling them users, but you may run into some instances where the distinction matters.\nWhen in doubt, be precise. You're counting clients.\nOpt-in vs Opt-out\nWe don't collect the same information from everyone.\nEvery profile that doesn't have Telemetry disabled sends us \"opt-out\" Telemetry. This includes:\n\nNearly everything in the Environment\nSome very specific Histograms, Scalars, and Events that are marked \"releaseChannelCollection\": \"opt-out\"\n\nMost probes are \"opt-in\": we do not get information from them unless the user opts into sending us this information. Users can opt-in in two ways:\n\nUsing Firefox's Options UI to tick the box that gives us permission\nInstalling any pre-release version of Firefox\n\nThe nature of selection bias is such that the population in #1 is useless for analysis. If you want to encourage users to collect good information for us, ask them to install Beta: it's only slightly harder than finding and checking the opt-in checkbox in Firefox.\nTrusting Dates\nDon't trust client times.\nAny timestamp recorded by the user is subject to \"clock skew.\" The user's clock can be set (purposefully or accidentally) to any time at all. The nature of SSL certificates tends to keep this within a certain relatively-accurate window, because a user who's clock is too far in the past or too far in the future might confuse certain expiration-date-checking code.\nExamples of client times: crashDate, crashTime, meta/Date, sessionStartDate, subsessionStartDate, profile/creationDate\nExamples of server times you can trust: Timestamp\nDate Formats\nNot all dates and times are created equal. Most of the dates and times in Telemetry pings are ISO 8601. Most are full timestamps, though their resolution may differ from being per-second to being per-day.\nThen there's profile/creationDate which is just a number of days since epoch. Like 17177 for the date 2017-01-11.\nTip: To convert profile/creationDate to a usable date in SQL: DATE_ADD('day', profile_created, DATE '1970-01-01')\nIn derived datasets ISO dates are sometimes converted to strings in one of two formats: %Y-%m-%d or %Y%m%d.\nBuild ids look like dates but aren't. If you take the first eight characters you can use that as a proxy for the day the build was released.\nDelays\nTelemetry data takes a while to get into our hands. The largest data mule in Telemetry is the main-ping. It is (pending bug 1336360) sent at the beginning of a client's next Firefox session. If the user shuts down their Firefox for the weekend, we won't get their Friday data until Monday morning.\nA rule of thumb (pending bug 1336360) is data from two days ago is usually fairly representative.\nIf you'd like to read more about this subject and look at pretty graphs, there are a series of blogposts

It contains values\nsuch as \"abouthome\", \"urlbar\", and \"searchbar\". The count field contains the number\nof searches performed against this engine+source combination during that subsession.\nAny of the fields in the struct may be null (for example if the search key did not\nmatch the expected pattern, or if the count was non-numeric).\nThe loop_activity_counter field is a simple struct containing inner fields for each\nexpected value of the LOOP_ACTIVITY_COUNTER Enumerated Histogram. Each inner field\nis a count for that histogram bucket.\nThe popup_notification_stats field is a map of String keys to struct values,\neach field in the struct being a count for the expected values of the\nPOPUP_NOTIFICATION_STATS Keyed Enumerated Histogram.\nThe places_bookmarks_count and places_pages_count fields contain the mean\nvalue of the corresponding Histogram, which can be interpreted as the average number\nof bookmarks or pages in a given subsession.\nThe active_addons field contains an array of structs, one for each entry in\nthe environment.addons.activeAddons section of the payload. More detail in\nBug 1290181.\nThe theme field contains a single struct in the same shape as the items in the\nactive_addons array. It contains information about the currently active browser\ntheme.\nThe user_prefs field contains a struct with values for preferences of interest.\n\nCode Reference\nThis dataset is generated by

dimensions for each day.\nRows and Columns\nThere's one column for each of the stratifying dimensions and the crash statistics.\nEach row is a distinct set of dimensions, along with their associated crash stats.\nExample stratifying dimensions include channel and country,\nexample statistics include usage hours and plugin crashes.\nSee the complete documentation\nfor all available dimensions\nand statistics.\nAccessing the Data\nThis dataset is accessible via re:dash.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/crash_aggregates/v1/\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for this dataset can be found in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nHere's an example query that computes crash rates\nfor each channel (sorted by number of usage hours):\nSELECT dimensions['channel'] AS channel,\n       sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS usage_hours,\n       1000 * sum(stats['main_crashes']) / sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS main_crash_rate,\n       1000 * sum(stats['content_crashes']) / sum(stats['usage_hours']) AS content_crash_rate,\n

thousand usage hours\nFROM channel_rates\nWHERE usage_kilohours > 100 -- only aggregates that have statistically significant usage hours\nORDER BY build_id ASC\n\nSampling\nInvalid Pings\nWe ignore invalid pings in our processing. Invalid pings are defined as those that:\n\nThe submission dates or activity dates are invalid or missing.\nThe build ID is malformed.\nThe docType field is missing or unknown.\nThe ping is a main ping without usage hours or a crash ping with usage hours.\n\nScheduling\nThe crash_aggregates job is run daily, at midnight UTC.\nThe job is scheduled on Airflow.\nThe DAG is here\nSchema\nThe crash_aggregates table has 4 commonly-used columns:\n\nsubmission_date is the date pings were submitted for a particular aggregate.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where submission_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by pings submitted on March 15, 2016.\nThe dataset is partitioned by this field. Queries that limit the possible values of submission_date can run significantly faster.\n\n\nactivity_date is the day when the activity being recorded took place.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where activity_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by activities that took place on March 15, 2016.\nThis can be several days before the pings are actually submitted, so it will always be before or on its corresponding submission_date.\nTherefore, queries that are sensitive to when measurements were taken on the client should prefer this field over submission_date.\n\n\ndimensions is a map of all the other dimensions that we currently care about. These fields include:\ndimensions['build_version'] is the program version, like 46.0a1.\ndimensions['build_id'] is the YYYYMMDDhhmmss timestamp the program was built, like 20160123180541. This is also known as the \"build ID\" or \"buildid\".\ndimensions['channel'] is the channel, like release or beta.\ndimensions['application'] is the program name, like Firefox or Fennec.\ndimensions['os_name'] is the name of the OS the program is running on, like Darwin or Windows_NT.\ndimensions['os_version'] is the version of the OS the program is running on.\ndimensions['architecture'] is the architecture that the program was built for (not necessarily the one it is running on).\ndimensions['country'] is the country code for the user (determined using geoIP), like US or UK.\ndimensions['experiment_id'] is the identifier of the experiment being participated in, such as e10s-beta46-noapz@experiments.mozilla.org, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['experiment_branch'] is the branch of the experiment being participated in, such as control or experiment, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['e10s_enabled'] is whether E10S is enabled.\ndimensions['e10s_cohort'] is the E10S cohort the user is part of, such as control, test, or disqualified.\ndimensions['gfx_compositor'] is the graphics backend compositor used by the program, such as d3d11, opengl and simple. Null values may be reported as none as well.\nAll of the above fields can potentially be blank, which means \"not present\". That means that in the actual pings, the corresponding fields were null.\n\n\nstats contains the aggregate values that we care about:\nstats['usage_hours'] is the number of user-hours represented by the aggregate.\nstats['main_crashes'] is the number of main process crashes represented by the aggregate (or just program crashes, in the non-E10S case).\nstats['content_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['plugin_crashes'] is the number of plugin process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['gmplugin_crashes'] is the number of Gecko media plugin (often abbreviated GMPlugin) process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['content_shutdown_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes that were caused by failure to shut down in a timely manner.\nstats['gpu_crashes'] is the number of gpu process crashes represented by the aggregate.\n\n\n\nTODO(harter):

data.\n"},"concepts/data_pipeline.html":{"url":"concepts/data_pipeline.html","title":"Overview of Mozilla's Data Pipeline","keywords":"","body":"An overview of Mozilla’s Data Pipeline\nThis post describes the architecture of Mozilla’s data pipeline, which is used to collect Telemetry data from our users and logs from various services. One of the cool perks of working at Mozilla is that most of what we do is out in the open and because of that I can do more than just show you some diagram with arrows of our architecture; I can point you to the code, script & configuration that underlies it!\nTo make the examples concrete, the following description is centered around the collection of Telemetry data. The same tool-chain is used to collect, store and analyze data coming from disparate sources though, such as service logs.\n\nFirefox\nThere are different APIs and formats to collect data in Firefox, all suiting different use cases:\n\nhistograms – for recording multiple data points;\nscalars – for recording single values;\ntimings – for measuring how long operations take;\nevents – for recording time-stamped events.\n\nThese are commonly referred to as probes. Each probe must declare the collection policy it conforms to: either opt-out (aka base telemetry) or opt-in (aka extended telemetry). When adding a new measurement data-reviewers carefully inspect the probe and eventually approve the requested collection policy:\n\nopt-out (base telemetry) data is collected by default from all Firefox users; users may choose to turn this data collection off in preferences;\nopt-in (extended telemetry) data is collected from users who explicitly express a choice to help with Firefox development; this includes all users who install pre-release & testing builds, plus release users who have explicitly checked the box in preferences.\n\nA session begins when Firefox starts up and ends when it shuts down. As a session could be long-running and last weeks, it gets sliced into smaller logical units called subsessions. Each subsession generates a batch of data containing the current state of all probes collected so far, i.e. a main ping, which is sent to our servers. The main ping is just one of the many ping types we support. Developers can create their own ping types if needed.\nPings are submitted via an API that performs a HTTP POST request to our edge servers. If a ping fails to successfully submit (e.g. because of missing internet connection), Firefox will store the ping on disk and retry to send it until the maximum ping age is exceeded.\nKafka\nHTTP submissions coming in from the wild hit a load balancer and then an NGINX module. The module accepts data via a HTTP request which it wraps in a Hindsight protobuf message and forwards to two places: a Kafka cluster and a short-lived S3 bucket (landfill) which acts as a fail-safe in case there is a processing error and/or data loss within the rest of the pipeline. The deployment scripts and configuration files of NGINX and Kafka live in a private repository.\nThe data from Kafka is read from the Complex Event Processors (CEP) and the Data Warehouse Loader (DWL), both of which use Hindsight.\nHindsight\nHindsight, an open source stream processing software system developed by Mozilla as Heka’s successor, is useful for a wide variety of different tasks, such as:\n\nconverting data from one format to another;\nshipping data from one location to another;\nperforming real time analysis, graphing, and anomaly detection.\n\nHindsight’s core is a lightweight data processing kernel written in C that controls a set of Lua plugins executed inside a sandbox.\nThe CEP are custom plugins that are created, configured and deployed from an UI which produce real-time plots like the number of pings matching a certain criteria.  Mozilla employees can access the UI and create/deploy their own custom plugin in real-time without interfering with other plugins running.\n\nThe DWL is composed of a set of plugins that transform, convert & finally shovel pings into S3 for long term storage. In the specific case of Telemetry data, an input plugin reads pings from Kafka, pre-processes them and sends batches to S3, our data lake, for long term storage. The data is compressed and partitioned by a set of dimensions, like date and application.\nThe data has traditionally been serialized to Protobuf sequence files which contain some nasty “free-form” JSON fields. Hindsight gained recently the ability to dump data directly in Parquet form though.\nThe deployment scripts and configuration files of the CEP & DWL live in a private repository.\nSpark\nOnce the data reaches our data lake on S3 it can be processed with Spark. We provide a portal (ATMO) that allows Mozilla employees to create their own Spark cluster pre-loaded with a set of libraries & tools, like jupyter, numpy, scipy, pandas etc., and an API to conveniently read data stored in Protobuf form on S3 in a Spark RDD using a ORM-like interface. Behind the scenes we use EMR to create Spark clusters, which are then monitored by ATMO.\n\nATMO is mainly used to write custom ad-hoc analyses; since our users aren’t necessary data engineers/scientists we chose Python as the main supported language to interface with Spark. From ATMO it’s also possible to schedule periodic notebook runs and inspect the results from a web UI.\nAs mentioned earlier, most of our data lake contains data serialized to Protobuf with free-form JSON fields. Needless to say, parsing JSON is terribly slow when ingesting TBs of data per day. A set of ETL jobs, written in Scala by Data Engineers and scheduled with Airflow, create Parquet views of our raw data. We have a Github repository telemetry-batch-view that showcases this.\nA dedicated Spark job feeds daily aggregates to a Postgres database which powers a HTTP service to easily retrieve faceted roll-ups. The service is mainly used by TMO, a dashboard that visualizes distributions and time-series, and cerberus, an anomaly detection tool that detects and alerts developers of changes in the distributions. Originally the sole purpose of the Telemetry pipeline was to feed data into this dashboard but in time its scope and flexibility grew to support more general use-cases.\n\nPresto & re:dash\nWe maintain a couple of Presto clusters and a centralized Hive metastore to query Parquet data with SQL. The Hive metastore provides an universal view of our Parquet dataset to both Spark and Presto clusters.\nPresto, and other databases, are behind a re:dash service (STMO) which provides a convenient & powerful interface to query SQL engines and build dashboards that can be shared within the company. Mozilla maintains its own fork of re:dash to iterate quickly on new features, but as good open source citizen we push our changes upstream.\n\nHBase\nWe use HBase to store the history of pings by client. It’s a relatively new addition and it provides support for fast needle-in-haystack queries.\nIs that it?\nNo, not really. For example, the DWL pushes some of the Telemetry data to Redshift and Elasticsearch but those tools satisfy more niche needs. The pipeline ingests logs from services as well and there are many specialized dashboards out there I haven’t mentioned. We also use Zeppelin as a means to create interactive data analysis notebooks that supports Spark, SQL, Scala and more.\nThere is a vast ecosystem of tools for processing data at scale, each with their pros & cons. The pipeline grew organically and we added new tools as new use-cases came up that we couldn’t solve with our existing stack. There are still scars left from that growth though which require some effort to get rid of, like ingesting data from schema-less format.\n"},"tools/interfaces.html":{"url":"tools/interfaces.html","title":"Interfaces","keywords":"","body":"Work in Progress\nThis document is a work in progress.\nThe work is being tracked in\nthis bug.\n"},"tools/spark.html":{"url":"tools/spark.html","title":"Custom analysis with Spark","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nSpark\nis a data processing engine designed to be fast and easy to use.\nWe have setup\nJupyter notebooks\nthat use Spark to analyze our Telemetry data.\nJupyter workbooks can be easily shared and updated among colleagues,\nand, when combined with Spark, enable richer analysis than SQL alone.\nThe Spark clusters can be spun up on ATMO.\nThe Spark Python API is called pyspark.\nSetting Up a Spark Cluster On ATMO\n\nGo to http://analysis.telemetry.mozilla.org\nClick “Launch an ad-hoc Spark cluster”.\nEnter some details:\nThe “Cluster Name” field should be a short descriptive name,\nlike “chromehangs analysis”.\nSet the number of workers for the cluster.

For example:\nssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -L 8890:localhost:8890\nhadoop@ec2-54-70-129-221.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\nUsing Spark\nSpark is a general-purpose cluster computing system - it allows users to\nrun general execution graphs. APIs are available in Python, Scala, and\nJava. The Jupyter notebook utilizes the Python API. In a nutshell, it\nprovides a way to run functional code (e.g. map, reduce, etc.) on large,\ndistributed data.\nCheck out \nSpark Best Practices\nfor tips on using Spark to it's full capabilities.\nSparkContext (sc)\nAccess to the Spark API is provided through SparkContext. In the Jupyter\nnotebook, this is the `sc` object. For example, to create a\ndistributed RDD of monotonically increasing numbers 1-1000:\nnumbers = range(1000)\n#no need to initialize sc in the Jupyter notebook\nnumsRdd = sc.parallelize(numbers)\nnums.take(10) #no guaranteed order\n\nSpark RDD\nThe Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is Spark's basic data structure.\nThe operations that are performed on these structures are distributed to\nthe cluster. Only certain actions (such as collect() or take(N)) pull an\nRDD in locally.\nRDD's are nice because there is no imposed schema - whatever they\ncontain, they distribute around the cluster. Additionally, RDD's can be\ncached in memory, which can greatly improve performance of some\nalgorithms that need access to data over and over again.\nAdditionally, RDD operations are all part of a directed, acyclic graph.\nThis gives increased redundancy, since Spark is always able to recreate\nan RDD from the base data (by rerunning the graph), but also provides\nlazy evaluation. No computation is performed while an RDD is just being\ntransformed (a la map), but when an action is taken (e.g. reduce, take)\nthe entire computation graph is evaluated. Continuing from our previous\nexample, the following gives some of the peaks of a sin wave:\nimport numpy as np\n#no computation is performed on the following line!\nsin_values = numsRdd.map(lambda x : np.float(x) / 10).map(lambda x : (x, np.sin(x)))\n#now the entire computation graph is evaluated\nsin_values.takeOrdered(5, lambda x : -x[1])\n\nFor jumping into working with Spark RDD's, we recommend reading the\nSpark Programming Guide.\nSpark SQL and Spark Dataframes/Datasets\nSpark also supports traditional SQL, along with special data structures\nthat require schemas. The Spark SQL API can be accessed with the\n`spark` object. For example:\nlongitudinal = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM longitudinal')\ncreates a DataFrame that contains all the longitudinal data. A Spark\nDataFrame is essentially a distributed table, a la Pandas or R\nDataframes. Under the covers they are an RDD of Row objects, and thus\nthe entirety of the RDD API is available for DataFrames, as well as a\nDataFrame specific API. For example, a sql-like way to get the count of\na specific OS:\nlongitudinal.select(\"os\").where(\"os = 'Darwin'\").count()\nTo Transform the DataFrame object to an RDD, simply do:\nlongitudinal_rdd = longitudinal.rdd\nIn general, however, the DataFrames are performance optimized, so it's\nworth the effort to learn the DataFrame API.\nFor more overview, see the \nSQL Programming Guide.\nSee also the \nLongitudinal Tutorial,\none of the available example notebooks when you start a cluster.\nAvailable Data Sources for SparkSQL\nFor information about available queryable data sources (e.g.  Longitudinal dataset), \nsee \nChoosing a Dataset.\nThese datasets are optimized for fast access, and will far out-perform\nanalysis on the raw telemetry ping data.\nAccessing the Spark UI\nGo to https://localhost:8888/spark after ssh-ing into the spark cluster\nto see the Spark UI.\nIt has information about job statuses and task completion,\nand may help you debug your job.\nThe MozTelemetry Library\nWe have provided a library that gives easy access to the raw telemetry ping data.\nFor example usage, see the \nTelemetry Hello World\nexample notebook.\nDetailed documentation for the library can be found at the \nPython MozTelemetry Documentation.\nUsing the Raw Ping Data\nFirst off, import the moztelemetry library using the following:\nfrom moztelemetry import get_pings\nIf you need any other functions, just comma separate them with\nget_pings.\nThe ping data is an RDD of JSON elements. For example, using the\nfollowing:\npings = get_pings(sc, app=\"Firefox\", channel=\"nightly\", build_id=(\"20160901000000\", \"20160901999999\"), fraction=0.01)\n\nreturns an RDD of 1/100th of Firefox Nightly JSON pings for all builds\nfrom September 1 2016. Now, because it's JSON, pings are easy to access.\nFor example, to get the count of each OS type:\nos_names = pings.map(lambda x : (x['environment']['system']['os']['name'], 1))`\\\nos_counts = os_names.reduceByKey(lambda x, y : x+y)`\\\nos_counts.collect()`\n\nAlternatively, moztelemetry provides the `get_pings_properties`\nfunction, which will gather the data for you:\nsubset = get_pings_properties(pings, [\"environment/system/os/name\"])`\\\nsubset.map(lambda x : (x[\"environment/system/os/name\"], 1)).reduceByKey(lambda x, y : x+y).collect()`\n\nFAQ\nPlease add more FAQ as questions are answered by you or for you.\nHow can I load parquet datasets in a Jupyter notebook?\nUse spark.read.parquet, e.g.:\ndataset = spark.read.parquet(\"s3://the_bucket/the_prefix/the_version\")`\n\nFor more information see\nWorking with Parquet.\nI got a REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! error\nAWS recycles hostnames, so this warning is expected.\nRemoving the offending key from $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts will remove the warning.\nYou can find the line to remove by finding the line in the output that says\nOffending key in /path/to/hosts/known_hosts:2\nWhere 2 is the line number of the key that can be deleted.\nJust remove that line, save the file, and try again.\nWhy is my notebook hanging?\nThere are a few common causes for this:\n\nCurrently, our Spark notebooks can only run a single Python kernel at\na time. If you open multiple notebooks on the same cluster and try to\nrun both, the second notebook will hang. Be sure to close notebooks\nusing \"Close and Halt\" under the \"File\" dropdown.\nThe connection from PySpark to the Spark driver might be lost.\nUnfortunately the best way to recover from this for the moment seems to\nbe spinning up a new cluster.\nCanceling execution of a notebook cell doesn't cancel any spark jobs\nthat might be running in the background. If your spark commands seem to\nbe hanging, try running `sc.cancelAllJobs()`.\n\nHow can I keep running after closing the notebook?\nFor long-running computation, it might be nice to close the notebook\n(and the ssh session) and look at the results later.\nUnfortunately, all cell output will be lost when a notebook is closed\n(for the running cell).\nTo alleviate this, there are a few options:\n\nHave everything output to a variable. These values should still be\navailable when you reconnect.\nPut %%capture at the beginning of the cell to store all output. \nSee the documentation.\n\nHow do I load an external library into the cluster?\nAssuming you've got a url for the repo, you can create an egg for it\nthis way:\n!git clone `` && cd `` && python setup.py bdist_egg`\\\nsc.addPyFile('``/dist/my-egg-file.egg')`\n\nAlternately, you could just create that egg locally, upload it to a web\nserver, then download and install it:\nimport requests`\\\nr = requests.get('``')`\\\nwith open('mylibrary.egg', 'wb') as f:`\\\n  f.write(r.content)`\\\nsc.addPyFile('mylibrary.egg')`\n\nYou will want to do this before you load the library. If the library\nis already loaded, restart the kernel in the ipython notebook.\n"},"cookbooks/realtime_analysis_plugin.html":{"url":"cookbooks/realtime_analysis_plugin.html","title":"Creating a Real-time Analysis Plugin","keywords":"","body":"Creating a Real-time Analysis Plugin\nGetting Started\nCreating an analysis plugin consists of three steps:\n\nWriting a message matcher\nThe message matcher allows one to select specific data from the data stream.\n\nWriting the analysis code/business logic\nThe analysis code allows one to aggregrate, detect anomalies, apply machine\nlearning algorithms etc.\n\nWriting the output code\nThe output code allows one to structure the analysis results in an easy to\nconsume format.\n\n\nStep by Step Setup\n\nGo to the CEP site: https://pipeline-cep.prod.mozaws.net/\n\nLogin/Register using your Google @mozilla.com account\n\nClick on the Plugin Deployment tab\n\nCreate a message matcher\n\nEdit the message_matcher variable in the Heka Analysis Plugin Configuration\ntext area.

If you're not sure which\ndataset to use for your query, this is probably what you want. It differs from\nthe main_summary table in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data for a client-id in the same row.\nThis makes it easy to report profile level metrics. Without this deduping,\nmetrics would be weighted by the number of submissions instead of by clients.\nThe dataset uses a 1% of all recent profiles, which will reduce query\ncomputation time and save resources. The sample of clients will be stable over\ntime.\n\nAccordingly, one should prefer using the Longitudinal dataset except in the\nrare case where a 100% sample is strictly necessary.\nAs discussed in the Longitudinal Data Set Example Notebook:\nThe longitudinal dataset is logically organized as a table where rows\nrepresent profiles and columns the various metrics (e.g. startup time). Each\nfield of the table contains a list of values, one per Telemetry submission\nreceived for that profile. [...]\n\nThe current version of the longitudinal dataset has been build with all\nmain pings received from 1% of profiles across all channels with [...] up to\n180 days of data.\nTable structure\nTo get an overview of the longitudinal data table:\nDESCRIBE longitudinal\n\nThat table has a row for each client, with columns for the different\nparts of the ping. There are a lot of fields here, so I recommend\ndownloading the results as a CSV if you want to search through these\nfields. Unfortunately, there's no way to filter the output of DESCRIBE\nin Presto.\nBecause this table combines all rows for a given client id, most columns\ncontain either Arrays or Maps (described below). A few properties are\ndirectly available to query on:\nSELECT count(*) AS count\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nArrays\nMost properties are arrays, which contain one entry for each submission\nfrom a given client (newest first). Note that indexing starts at 1:\nSELECT reason[1] AS newest_reason\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nTo expand arrays and maps and work on the data row-wise we can use\nUNNEST(array).\nWITH lengths AS\n  (SELECT os, greatest(-1, least(31, sl / (24*60*60))) AS days\n   FROM longitudinal\n   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(session_length, reason) AS t(sl, r)\n   WHERE r = 'shutdown' OR r = 'aborted-session')\nSELECT os, days, count(*) AS count\nFROM lengths\nGROUP BY days, os ORDER BY days ASC\n\nHowever, it may be better to use a sample from the main_summary table\ninstead.\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on array\nfunctions\nUNNEST\ndocumentation\n\nMaps\nSome fields like active_addons or user_prefs are handled as maps, on\nwhich you can use the [] operator and special functions:\nWITH adp AS\n  (SELECT active_addons[1]['{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}']\n            IS NOT null AS has_adblockplus\n   FROM longitudinal)\nSELECT has_adblockplus, count(*) AS count\nFROM adp GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on map\nfunctions\n\nSampling\nWhile composing queries, it can be helpful to work on small samples to\nreduce query runtimes:\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal LIMIT 1000 ...\n\nThere's no need to use other sampling methods, such as TABLESAMPLE, on\nthe longitudinal set. Rows are randomly ordered, so a LIMIT sample is\nexpected to be random.\nExample Queries\nBlocklist URLs (extensions.blocklist.url)\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).user_prefs['extensions.blocklist.url'] AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nBlocklist enabled/disabled (extensions.blocklist.enabled) count:\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).blocklist_enabled AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nParsing most recent submission_date\nSELECT DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z') as parsed_submission_date\nFROM longitudinal\n\nLimiting to most recent ping in the last 7 days\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal\nWHERE DATE_DIFF('day', DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z'), current_date) \nScalar measurement (how many users with more than 100 tabs)\nWITH samples AS\n (SELECT\n   client_id,\n   normalized_channel as channel,\n   mctc.value AS max_concurrent_tabs\n  FROM longitudinal\n  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count) as t (mctc)\n  WHERE\n   scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count is not null and\n   mctc.value is not null and\n   normalized_channel = 'nightly')\nSELECT approx_distinct(client_id) FROM samples WHERE max_concurrent_tabs > 100\n\nUsing Views\nIf you find yourself copy/pasting SQL between different queries,\nconsider using a Presto VIEW to allow for code reuse. Views create\nlogical tables which you can reuse in other queries. For example, this\nview defines some\nimportant filters and derived variables which are then used in this\ndownstream\nquery.\nYou can define a view by prefixing your query with\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS ...\n\nBe careful not to overwrite an existing view! Using a unique name is\nimportant.\nFind more information\nhere.\nWorking offline\nIt's often useful to keep a local sample of the l10l data when\nprototyping an analysis.
