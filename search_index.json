Main pings contain some combination of environment data (e.g. operating system, hardware, Firefox version), measurements (e.g. max number of open tabs, time spent running in JavaScript garbage collection), and events. We have quite a few different pings, but most of our data for Firefox Desktop comes in from main pings.\nMeasurement Types\nWhen we need to measure specific things about clients, we use probes. A single ping will send in many different probes. There are two types of probes that we are interested in here: Histograms and Scalars.\nHistograms are bucketed counts. The Histograms.json file has the definitions for all histograms, which includes the minimum, maximum, and number of buckets. Any recorded value instead just increments its associated bucket. We have four main types of histograms:\n\nBoolean - Only two buckets, associated with true and false.\nEnumerated - Integer buckets, where usually each bucket has a label.\nLinear - Buckets are divided evenly between the minimum and maximum; e.g. [1-2] is a bucket, and so is [100-101].\nExponential - Larger valued buckets cover a larger range; e.g. [1-2] is a bucket, and so is [100-200].\n\nTo see some of these in action, take a look at the Histogram Simulator.\nScalars are simply a single value. The Scalars.yaml file has the definitions for all scalars. These values can be integers, strings, or booleans.\nTMO\nThe simplest way to start looking at probe data is to head over to telemetry.mozilla.org or TMO for short.\nFrom there, you will likely want either the Measurement Dashboard or the Evolution Dashboard. Using these dashboards you can compare a probe's value between populations, e.g. GC_MS for 64 bit vs. 32 bit, and even track it across builds.\nThe Measurement Dashboard is a snapshot, aggregating all the data from all chosen dimensions. The Y axis is % of samples, and the X axis is the bucket. You can compare between dimensions, but it does not give you the ability to see how data is changing over time. To investigate that you must use the Evolution Dashboard.\nThe Evolution Dashboard shows how the data changes over time. Choose which statistics you'd like to plot over time, e.g. Median or 95th percentile. The X axis is time, and the Y axis is the value for whichever statistic you've chosen. This dashboard, for example, shows how GC_MS is improving from nightly 53 to nightly 56! While the median is not changing much, the 95th percentile is trending down, indicating that long garbage collections are being shortened.\nThe X axis on the Evolution Dashboard shows either Build ID (a date), or Submission Date. The difference is that on any single date we might receive submissions from lots of builds, but aggregating by Build ID means we can be sure a change was because of a new build.\nThe second plot on the Evolution View is the number of pings we saw containing that probe (Metric Count).\nTMO Caveats\n\nData is aggregated on a per-ping basis, meaning these dashboards cannot be used to say something definitive about users. Please repeat that to yourself. A trend in the evolution view may be caused not by a change affecting lots of users, but a change affecting one single user who is now sending 50% of the pings we see. And yes, that does happen.\nSometimes it looks like no data is there, but you think there should be. Check under advanced settings and check \"Don't Sanitize\" and \"Don't Trim Buckets\". If it's still not there, let us know in IRC on #telemetry.\nTMO Measurement Dashboards do not currently show release-channel data. Release-channel data ceased being aggregated as of Firefox 58. We're looking into ways of doing this correctly in the near future.\n\nWhere to go next\n\nAnalysis using STMO\nAdvanced analysis with ATMO\nExperimental data\nAdding probes, collecting more

document will help you find the best data source for a given analysis.\nThis guide focuses on descriptive datasets and does not cover experimentation.\nFor example, this guide will help if you need to

Derived Datasets\nUpdate Derived Dataset\nOther Datasets\nObsolete Datasets\nheavy_users\n\n\nAppendix\nMobile Metrics\n\n\n\n\nRaw Pings\nWe receive data from our users via pings.\nThere are several types of pings,\neach containing different measurements and sent for different purposes.\nTo review a complete list of ping types and their schemata, see\nthis section of the Mozilla Source Tree Docs.\nMany pings are also described by a JSONSchema specification which can be found in this repository.\nBackground and Caveats\nThe large majority of analyses can be completed using only the\nmain ping.\nThis ping includes histograms, scalars, events, and other performance and diagnostic data.\nFew analyses actually rely directly on the raw ping data.\nInstead, we provide derived datasets which are processed versions of these data,\nmade to be:\n\nEasier and faster to query\nOrganized to make the data easier to analyze\nCleaned of erroneous or misleading data\n\nBefore analyzing raw ping data,\ncheck to make sure there isn't already a derived dataset made for your purpose.\nIf you do need to work with raw ping data, be aware that loading the data can take a while.\nTry to limit the size of your data by controlling the date range, etc.\nAccessing the Data\nYou can access raw ping data from an ATMO cluster using the Dataset API.\nRaw ping data are not available in re:dash.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find the complete ping documentation.\nTo augment our data collection, see Collecting New Data and the\nData Collection Policy.\nMain Ping Derived Datasets\nThe main ping\ncontains most of the measurements used to track performance and health of Firefox in the wild.\nThis ping includes histograms, scalars, and events.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\nlongitudinal\nThe longitudinal dataset is a 1% sample of main ping data\norganized so that each row corresponds to a client_id.\nIf you're not sure which dataset to use for your analysis,\nthis is probably what you want.\nContents\nEach row in the longitudinal dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column represents a field from the main ping.\nMost fields contain arrays of values, with one value for each ping associated with a client_id.\nUsing arrays give you access to the raw data from each ping,\nbut can be difficult to work with from SQL.\nHere's a query showing some sample data\nto help illustrate.\nTake a look at the longitudinal examples if you get stuck.\nBackground and Caveats\nThink of the longitudinal table as wide and short.\nThe dataset contains more columns than main_summary\nand down-samples to 1% of all clients to reduce query computation time and save resources.\nIn summary, the longitudinal table differs from main_summary in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data so that one row represents a client_id\nThe longitudinal dataset samples to 1% of all client_ids\n\nPlease note that this dataset only contains release (or opt-out) histograms and scalars.\nAccessing the Data\nThe longitudinal is available in re:dash,\nthough it can be difficult to work with the array values in SQL.\nTake a look at this example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data\nin Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/longitudinal/\nmain_summary\nThe main_summary table is the most direct representation of a main ping\nbut can be difficult to work with due to its size. \nPrefer the longitudinal dataset unless using the sampled data is prohibitive.\nContents\nThe main_summary table contains one row for each ping.\nEach column represents one field from the main ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all main ping fields are included.\nThis dataset does not include histograms.\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is massive, and due to its size, it can be difficult to work with.\nYou should avoid querying main_summary from re:dash.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash on a shared cluster.\nInstead, we recommend using the longitudinal or clients_daily dataset where possible.\nIf these datasets do not suffice, consider using Spark on an\nATMO cluster.\nIn the odd case where these queries are necessary,\nmake use of the sample_id field and limit to a short submission date range.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/main_summary/v4/\nThough not recommended main_summary is accessible through re:dash. \nHere's an example query.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash is on a shared cluster.\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for main_summary is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is \nhere\nfirst_shutdown_summary\nThe first_shutdown_summary table is a summary of the first-shutdown\nping. \nContents\nThe first shutdown ping contains first session usage data. The\ndataset has rows similar to the\ntelemetry_new_profile_parquet,\nbut in the shape of\nmain_summary. \nBackground and Caveats\nPing latency was reduced through the\nshutdown ping-sender mechanism in Firefox 55. To maintain consistent historical\nbehavior, the first main ping is not sent until the second start up. In Firefox 57, a\nseparate first-shutdown ping was created to evaluate first-shutdown behavior while maintaining backwards compatibility.\nIn many cases, the first-shutdown ping is a duplicate of the main ping. The first-shutdown summary can be used in conjunction with the main summary by taking the union and deduplicating on the document_id.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data can be accessed as first_shutdown_summary. It is currently stored in the following path.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/first_shutdown_summary/v4/\nThe data is backfilled to 2017-09-22, the date of its first nightly appearance. This data should be available to all releases on and after Firefox 57.\nclient_count_daily\nThe client_count_daily dataset is useful for estimating user counts over a few\npre-defined dimensions.\nThe client_count_daily dataset is similar to the deprecated\nclient_count dataset\nexcept that is aggregated by submission date and not activity date.\nContent\nThis dataset includes columns for a dozen factors and an HLL variable.\nThe hll column contains a\nHyperLogLog\nvariable, which is an approximation to the exact count.\nThe factor columns include submission date and the dimensions listed\nhere.\nEach row represents one combinations of the factor columns.\nBackground and Caveats\nIt's important to understand that the hll column is not a standard count.\nThe hll variable avoids double-counting users when aggregating over multiple days.\nThe HyperLogLog variable is a far more efficient way to count distinct elements of a set,\nbut comes with some complexity.\nTo find the cardinality of an HLL use cardinality(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nTo find the union of two HLL's over different dates, use merge(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nThe Firefox ER Reporting Query\nis a good example to review.\nFinally, Roberto has a relevant write-up\nhere.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is available in Re:dash.\nTake a look at this\nexample query.\nI don't recommend accessing this data from ATMO.\nFurther Reading\nchurn\nThe churn dataset tracks the 7-day churn rate of telemetry profiles. This\ndataset is generally used for analyzing cohort churn across segments and time.\nContent\nChurn is the rate of attrition defined by (clients seen in week N)/(clients seen in week 0)\nfor groups of clients with some shared attributes. A group of clients with\nshared attributes is called a cohort. The cohorts in this dataset are created\nevery week and can be tracked over time using the acquisition_date and the\nweeks since acquisition or current_week.\nThe following example demonstrates the current logic for generating this\ndataset. Each column represents the days since some arbitrary starting date.\n\n\n\nclient\n00\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nAll three clients are part of the same cohort. Client A is retained for weeks 0\nand 1 since there is activity in both periods. A client only needs to show up\nonce in the period to be counted as retained. Client B is acquired in week 0 and\nis active frequently but does not appear in following weeks. Client B is\nconsidered churned on week 1. However, a client that is churned can become\nretained again. Client C is considered churned on week 1 but retained on week 3.\nThe following table summarizes the above daily activity into the following view\nwhere every column represents the current week since acquisition date..\n\n\n\nclient\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\nX\n\n\n\nB\nX\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\nX\n\n\n\nThe clients are then grouped into cohorts by attributes. An attribute describes\na property about the cohort such as the country of origin or the binary\ndistribution channel. Each group also contains descriptive aggregates of\nengagement. Each metric describes the activity of a cohort such as size and\noverall usage at a given time instance.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nEach row in this dataset describes a unique segment of users\nThe number of rows is exponential with the number of dimensions\nNew fields should be added sparing to account for data-set size\n\n\nThe dataset lags by 10 days in order account for submission latency\nThis value was determined to be time for 99% of main pings to arrive at the\nserver. With the shutdown-ping sender, this has been reduced to 4 days.\nHowever, churn_v3 still tracks releases older than Firefox 55.\n\n\nThe start of the period is fixed to Sundays. Once it has been aggregated, the\nperiod cannot be shifted due to the way clients are counted.\nA supplementary 1-day retention dataset using HyperLogLog for client\ncounts is available for counting over arbitrary retention periods and date\noffsets. Additionally, calculating churn or retention over specific cohorts\nis tractable in STMO with main_summary or clients_daily datasets.\n\n\n\nAccessing the Data\nchurn is available in Re:dash under Athena and Presto. The data is also\navailable in parquet for consumption by columnar data engines at\ns3://telemetry-parquet/churn/v3.\nretention\nThe retention table provides client counts relevant to client retention at a\n1-day granularity. The project is tracked in Bug 1381840\nContents\nThe retention table contains a set of attribute columns used to specify a\ncohort of users and a set of metric columns to describe cohort activity. Each\nrow contains a permutation of attributes, an approximate set of clients in a\ncohort, and the aggregate engagement metrics.\nThis table uses the HyperLogLog (HLL) sketch to create an approximate set of\nclients in a cohort. HLL allows counting across overlapping cohorts in a single\npass while avoiding the problem of double counting. This data-structure has the\nbenefit of being compact and performant in the context of retention analysis,\nat the expense of precision. For example, calculating a 7-day retention period\ncan be obtained by aggregating over a week of retention data using the union\noperation. With SQL primitive, this requires a recalculation of COUNT DISTINCT\nover client_id's in the 7-day window.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nThe data starts at 2017-03-06, the merge date where Nightly started to\ntrack Firefox 55 in Mozilla-Central. However, there was\nnot a consistent view into the behavior of first session profiles until the\nnew_profile ping. This means much of the data is inaccurate\nbefore 2017-06-26.\nThis dataset uses 4 day reporting latency to aggregate at least 99% of the\ndata in a given submission date. This figure is derived from the\ntelemetry-health measurements on submission latency, with\nthe discussion in Bug 1407410. This latency metric was reduced\nFirefox 55 with the introduction of the shutdown ping-sender mechanism.\nCaution should be taken before adding new columns. Additional attribute\ncolumns will grow the number of rows exponentially.\nThe number of HLL bits chosen for this dataset is 13. This means the default\nsize of the HLL object is 2^13 bits or 1KiB. This maintains about a 1% error\non average. See this table from Algebird's HLL implementation for\nmore details.\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is primarily available through Re:dash on STMO via\nthe Presto source. This service has been configured to use predefined HLL\nfunctions.\nThe column should first be cast to the HLL type. The scalar\ncardinality() function will approximate the number of unique\nitems per HLL object. The aggregate merge() function will perform\nthe set union between all objects in a column.\nExample: Cast the count column into the appropriate type.\nSELECT cast(hll as HLL) as n_profiles_hll FROM retention\n\nCount the number of clients seen over all attribute combinations.\nSELECT cardinality(cast(hll as HLL)) FROM retention\n\nGroup-by and aggregate client counts over different release channels.\nSELECT channel, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))\nFROM retention\nGROUP BY channel\n\nThe HyperLogLog library wrappers are available for use outside of the\nconfigured STMO environment, spark-hyperloglog and\npresto-hyperloglog.\nAlso see the client_count_daily dataset.\nclients_daily\nThe clients_daily table is intended as the first stop for asking questions\nabout how people use Firefox. It should be easy to answer simple questions.\nEach row in the table is a (client_id, submission_date) and contains a\nnumber of aggregates about that day's activity.\nContents\nMany questions about Firefox take the form \"What did clients with\ncharacteristics X, Y, and Z do during the period S to E?\" The\nclients_daily table is aimed at answer those questions.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/clients_daily/v6/\nThe clients_daily table is accessible through re:dash using the Athena\ndata source. It is also available via the Presto data source, though\nAthena should be preferred for performance and stability reasons.\nHere's an example query.\nCrash Ping Derived Datasets\nThe crash ping\nis captured after the main Firefox process crashes or after a content process crashes,\nwhether or not the crash report is submitted to crash-stats.mozilla.org.\nIt includes non-identifying metadata about the crash.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\ncrash_aggregates\nThe crash_aggregates dataset compiles crash statistics over various dimensions for each day.\nRows and Columns\nThere's one column for each of the stratifying dimensions and the crash statistics.\nEach row is a distinct set of dimensions, along with their associated crash stats.\nExample stratifying dimensions include channel and country,\nexample statistics include usage hours and plugin crashes.\nSee the complete documentation\nfor all available dimensions\nand statistics.\nAccessing the Data\nThis dataset is accessible via re:dash.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/crash_aggregates/v1/\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for this dataset can be found in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation\ncrash_summary\nThe crash_summary table is the most direct representation of a crash ping.\nContents\nThe crash_summary table contains one row for each crash ping.\nEach column represents one field from the crash ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all crash ping fields are included.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/crash_summary/v1/\ncrash_summary is accessible through re:dash.\nHere's an example query.\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for crash_summary is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is\nhere\nNew-Profile Derived Datasets\nThe new-profile ping\nis sent from Firefox Desktop on the first session of a newly created profile and contains the initial\ninformation about the user environment.\nThis data is available in the telemetry_new_profile_parquet dataset.\nThe telemetry_new_profile_parquet table is the most direct representation of a new-profile ping.\nContents\nThe table contains one row for each ping.

A client has a row for a specific submission_date if\nthey were active at all in the 28 day window ending on that submission_date.\nA user is a \"heavy user\" as of day N if, for the 28 day period ending\non day N, the sum of their active_ticks is in the 90th percentile (or\nabove) of all clients during that period. For more analysis on this,\nand a discussion of new profiles, see\nthis link.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nData starts at 20170801. There is technically data in the table before\nthis, but the heavy_user column is NULL for those dates because it\nneeded to bootstrap the first 28 day window.\nBecause it is top the 10% of clients for each 28 day period, more\nthan 10% of clients active on a given submission_date will be\nconsidered heavy users. If you join with another data source\n(main_summary, for example), you may see a larger proportion of heavy\nusers than expected.\nEach day has a separate, but related, set of heavy users. Initial\ninvestigations show that approximately 97.5% of heavy users as of a\ncertain day are still considered heavy users as of the next day.\nThere is no \"fixing\" or weighting of new profiles - days before the\nprofile was created are counted as zero active_ticks. Analyses may\nneed to use the included profile_creation_date field to take this\ninto account.\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is available both via sql.t.m.o and Spark.\nIn Spark:\nspark.read.parquet(\"s3://telemetry-parquet/heavy_users/v1\")\n\nIn SQL:\nSELECT * FROM heavy_users LIMIT 3\n\nFurther Reading\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is\nhere\nAppendix\nMobile Metrics\nThere are several tables owned by the mobile team documented\nhere:\n\nandroid_events\nandroid_clients\nandroid_addons\nmobile_clients\n\n"},"tools/stmo.html":{"url":"tools/stmo.html","title":"Intro to STMO","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nSTMO is shorthand for\nsql.telemetry.mozilla.org, an installation\nof the excellent Re:dash data analysis and dashboarding\ntool that has been customized and configured for use with a number of the\nFirefox organization's data sets. As the name and URL imply, effective use of\nthis tool requires familiarity with the\nSQL query language, with which all of the\ntool's data extraction and analysis are performed.\nConcepts\nThere are three building block from which analyses in STMO are constructed:\nqueries, visualizations, and dashboards.\nQueries\nSTMO's basic unit of analysis is the query. A query is a block of SQL code that\nextracts and (optionally) transforms data from a single data source. Queries\ncan vary widely in complexity. Some queries are trivial one liners\n(e.g. SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 10), while others are many pages long,\nsmall programs in their own right.\nThe raw output from a query is tabular data, where each row is one set of\nreturn values for the query's output columns. A query can be run manually or it\ncan be specified to have a refresh schedule, where it will execute\nautomatically after a specified interval of time.\nVisualizations\nTabular data is great, but rarely is a grid of values the best way to make\nsense of your data. Each query can be associated with multiple visualizations,\neach visualization rendering the extracted data in some more useful\nformat. There are many visualization types, including charts (line, bar, area,\npie, etc.), counters, maps, pivot tables, and more. Each visualization type\nprovides a set of configuration parameters that allow you to specify how to map\nfrom the raw query output to the desired visualization. Some visualization types\nmake demands of the query output; a map visualization requires each row to contain\na longitude value and a latitude value, for instance.\nDashboards\nA dashboard is a collection of visualizations, combined into a single visual\npresentation for convenient perusal. A dashboard is decoupled from any\nparticular queries. While it is possible to include multiple visualizations\nfrom a single query in one dashboard, it is not required; users can add any\nvisualizations they can access to the dashboards they create.\nData Sources\nSQL provides the ability to extract and manipulate the data, but you won't get\nvery far without having some familiarity with what data is actually available,\nand how that data is structured. Each query in STMO is associated with exactly\none data source, and you have to know ahead of time which data source contains\nthe information that you need. One of the most commonly used data sources is\ncalled Athena (referring to Amazon's Athena\nquery service, on which it is built), which contains most of the data that is\nobtained from telemetry pings received from Firefox clients. The Athena\nsource is slowly replacing the Presto data source. Presto contains all of\nthe data that's exposed via Athena and more, but returns query results much\nmore slowly.\nOther available data sources include Crash DB, Tiles, Sync Stats, Push,\nTest Pilot, ATMO, and even a Re:dash metadata which connects to STMO's\nown Re:dash database. You can learn more about the available data sets and how\nto find the one that's right for you on the Choosing a\ndataset page. If you have data set\nquestions, or would like to know if specific data is or can be made available\nin STMO, please inquire in the #datapipeline or #datatools channels on\nirc.mozilla.org.\nCreating an Example Dashboard\nThe rest of this document will take you through the process of creating a\nsimple dashboard using STMO.\nCreating A Query\nWe start by creating a query. Our first query will count the number of client\nids that we have coming from each country, for the top N countries. Clicking on\nthe 'New Query' button near the top left of the site will bring you to the\nquery editing page:\n\nFor this (and most queries where we're counting distinct client IDs) we'll want\nto use the client_count_daily data\nset that is generated from\nFirefox telemetry pings.\n\nCheck if the data set is in Athena\nAs mentioned above, Athena is faster than Presto, but not all data sets are\nyet available in Athena. We can check to see if the one we want is available\nin the by typing client_count_daily into the \"Search schema...\"  search box above\nthe schema browser interface to the left of the main query edit box. As of\nthis writing, alas, there are no matches for client_count_daily, which means this\ndata set is not available in Athena.\n\nVerify the data set exists in Presto\nIt's not in Athena, so now we should check to see if it's in Presto. If you\nclick on the 'Data Source' drop-down and change the selection from 'Athena' to\n'Presto' (with client_count_daily still populating the filter input), you should\nsee that there is, in fact, a client_count_daily data set (showing up as\ndefault.client_count_daily), as well as versioned client_count_daily data\nsets (showing up as default.client_count_daily_v).\n\nIntrospect the available columns\nClicking on the default.client_count_daily in the schema browser exposes the\ncolumns that are available in the data set. Two of the columns are of\ninterest to us for this query: country (for obvious reasons) and hll.\n\n\nThe hll column bears some explanation. hll stands for\nHyperLogLog, a sophisticated\nalgorithm that allows for the counting of extremely high numbers of items,\nsacrificing a small amount of accuracy in exchange for using much less memory\nthan a simple counting structure. The client_count_daily data set uses the hll\ncolumn for all of its counting functionality. Converting the hll value back\nto a regular numeric value requires the use of the following magic SQL\nincantation:\n  cardinality(merge(cast(hll as HLL)))\nSo a query that extracts all of the unique country values and the count for\neach one, sorted from highest count to lowest count looks like this:\n  SELECT country,\n         cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count\n  FROM client_count_daily\n  GROUP BY 1\n  ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nIf you type that into the main query edit box and then click on the \"Execute\"\nbutton, you should see a blue bar appear below the edit box containing the text\n\"Executing query...\" followed by a timer indicating how long the query has been\nrunning. After a reasonable (for some definition of \"reasonable\", usually about\none to two minutes) amount of time the query should complete, resulting in a\ntable showing a client count value for each country. Congratulations, you've\njust created and run your first STMO query!\nNow would be a good time to click on the large \"New Query\" text near the top of\nthe page; it should turn into an edit box, allowing you to rename the\nquery. For this exercise, you should use a unique prefix (such as your name)\nfor your query name, so it will be easy to find your query later; I used\nrmiller:Top Countries.\nCreating A Visualization\nNow that the query is created, we'll want to provide a simple\nvisualization. The table with results from the first query execution should be\nshowing up underneath the query edit box. Next to the TABLE heading should be\nanother heading entitled +NEW VISUALIZATION.\n\nClicking on the +NEW VISUALIZATION link should bring you to the\n\"Visualization Editor\" screen, where you can specify a visualization name (\"Top\nCountries bar chart\"), a chart type (\"Bar\"), an x-axis column (country), and\na y-axis column (client_count).:\n\nAfter the GENERAL settings have been specified, we'll want to tweak a few\nmore settings on the X AXIS tab. You'll want to click on this tab and then\nchange the 'Scale' setting to 'Category', and un-check the 'Sort Values'\ncheck-box to allow the query's sort order to take precedence:\n\nA Note About Limits\nOnce you save the visualization settings and return to the query source page,\nyou should have a nice bar graph near the bottom of the page. You may notice,\nhowever, that the graph has quite a long tail. Rather than seeing all of\nthe countries, it might be nicer to only see the top 20. We can do this by adding\na LIMIT clause to the end of our query:\n  SELECT country, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count_daily GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 20\nIf you edit the query to add a limit clause and again hit the 'Execute' button,\nyou should get a new bar graph that only shows the 20 countries with the\nhighest number of unique clients. In this case, the full data set has\napproximately 250 return values, and so limiting the result count improves\nreadability. In other cases, however, an unlimited query might return thousands\nor even millions of rows. When those queries are run, readability is not the\nonly problem; queries that return millions of rows can tax the system, failing\nto return the desired results, and negatively impacting the performance of all\nof the other users of the system. Thus, a very important warning:\n  ALL QUERIES SHOULD INCLUDE A \"LIMIT\" STATEMENT BY DEFAULT!\nYou should be in the habit of adding a \"LIMIT 100\" clause to the end of all new\nqueries, to prevent your query from returning a gigantic data set that causes\nUI and performance problems. You may learn that the total result set is small\nenough that the limit is unnecessary, but unless you're certain that is the\ncase specifying an explicit LIMIT helps prevent unnecessary issues.\nQuery Parameters\nWe got our chart under control by adding a \"LIMIT 20\" clause at the end. But\nwhat if we only want the top 10? Or maybe sometimes we want to see the top 30?\nWe don't always know how many results our users will want. Is it possible to\nallow users to specify how many results they want to see?\nAs you've probably guessed, I wouldn't be asking that question if the answer\nwasn't \"yes\". STMO allows queries to accept user arguments by the use of double\ncurly-braces around a variable name. So our query now becomes the following:\n  SELECT country, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count_daily GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT {{country_count}}\nOnce you replace the hard coded limit value with {{country_count}} you should\nsee an input field show up directly above the bar chart. If you enter a numeric\nvalue into this input box and click on 'Execute' the query will run with the\nspecified limit. Clicking on the 'Save' button will then save the query, using\nthe entered parameter value as the default.\nCreating A Dashboard\nNow we can create a dashboard to display our visualization. Do this by clicking\non the 'Dashboards' drop-down near the top left of the page, and then clicking\nthe 'New Dashboard' option. Choose a name for your dashboard, and you will be\nbrought to a mostly empty page. Clicking on the '...' button near the top right\nof the page will give you the option to 'Add Widget'. This displays the\nfollowing dialog:\n\nThe \"Search a query by name\" field is where you can enter in the unique prefix\nused in your query name to find the query you created. This will not yet work,\nhowever, because your query isn't published. Publishing a query makes it show\nup in searches and on summary pages. Since this is only an exercise, we won't\nwant to leave our query published, but it must be published briefly in order to\nadd it to our dashboard. You can publish your query by returning to the query\nsource page and clicking the \"Publish\" button near the top right of the screen.\nOnce your query is published, it should show up in the search results when you\ntype your unique prefix into the \"Search a query by name\" field on the \"Add\nWidget\" dialog. When you select your query, a new \"Choose Visualization\"\ndrop-down will appear, allowing you to choose which of the query's\nvisualizations to use. Choose the bar chart you created and then click on the\n\"Add to Dashboard\" button. Voila! Now your dashboard should have a bar chart,\nand you should be able to edit the country_count value and click the refresh\nbutton to change the number of countries that show up on the chart.\nCompleting the Dashboard\nA dashboard with just one graph is a bit sad, so let's flesh it out by adding a\nhandful of additional widgets. We're going to create three more queries, each\nwith a very similar bar chart. The text of the queries will be provided here,\nbut creating the queries and the visualizations and wiring them up to the\ndashboard will be left as an exercise to the user. The queries are as follows:\n\nTop OSes (recommended os_count value == 6)\nSELECT os, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count_daily GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT\n\nChannel Counts\nSELECT normalized_channel AS channel, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count_daily GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nApp Version Counts (recommended app_version_count value == 20)\nSELECT app_name, app_version, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))) AS client_count FROM client_count_daily GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 3 DESC LIMIT\n\n\nCreating bar charts for these queries and adding them to the original dashboard\ncan result in a dashboard resembling this:\n\nSome final notes to help you create your dashboards:\n\nDon't forget that you'll need to publish each of your queries before you can\nadd its visualizations to your dashboard.\n\nSimilarly, it's a good idea to un-publish any test queries after you've used\nthem in a dashboard so as not to permanently pollute everyone's search results\nwith your tests and experiments. Queries that are the result of actual\nwork-related analysis should usually remain published, so others can see and\nlearn from them.\n\nThe 'Firefox' label on the 'App Version counts' graph is related to the use\nof the 'Group by' visualization setting. I encourage you to experiment with\nthe use of 'Group by' in your graphs to learn more about how this can be\nused.\n\nThis tutorial has only scratched the surface of the wide variety of very\nsophisticated visualizations supported by STMO. You can see a great many much\nmore sophisticated queries and dashboards by browsing around and exploring\nthe work that has been published by others.\n\nThe Re:dash help center is useful for further deep\ndiving into Re:dash and all of its capabilities.\n\n\nPrototyping Queries\nSometimes you want to start working on your query before the data is available.\nYou can do this with most of the data sources by selecting a static test data\nset, then working with it as usual. You can also use this method to explore\nhow a given SQL backend behaves.\nNote that UNION ALL will retain duplicate rows while UNION will discard them.\nHere are a couple of examples:\nSimple three-column test dataset\nWITH test AS (\n SELECT 1 AS client_id, 'foo' AS v1, 'bar' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 2 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'baz' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 3 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'bar' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 2 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'baz' AS v2 UNION ALL\n SELECT 3 AS client_id, 'bla' AS v1, 'bar' AS v2\n)\n\nSELECT * FROM test\n\nConvert a semantic version string to a sortable array field\nWITH foo AS (\n SELECT '1.0.1' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.10.3' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.0.2' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.1' AS v UNION\n -- Doesn't work with these type of strings due to casting\n -- SELECT '1.3a1' AS v UNION\n SELECT '1.2.1' AS v\n)\n\nSELECT cast(split(v, '.') AS array) FROM foo ORDER BY 1\n\nHow do boolean fields get parsed from strings?\nWITH bar AS (\n SELECT '1' AS b UNION\n SELECT '0' UNION\n SELECT 't' UNION\n SELECT 'f' UNION\n SELECT 'true' UNION\n SELECT 'false' UNION\n SELECT 'turkey'\n)\nSELECT b, try(cast(b AS boolean)) from bar\n\n"},"concepts/analysis_gotchas.html":{"url":"concepts/analysis_gotchas.html","title":"Common Analysis Gotchas","keywords":"","body":"Analysis Gotchas\nWhen performing analysis on any data there are some mistakes that are easy to make and details that are easy to overlook. Do you know exactly what question you hope to answer? Is your sample representative of your population? Is your result \"real\"? How precisely can you state your conclusion?\nThis document is not about those traps. Instead, it is about quirks and pitfalls specific to Telemetry.\nPseudo-replication\nTelemetry data is a collection of pings. A single main-ping represents a single subsession. Some clients have more subsessions than others.\nSo when you say \"63% of beta 53 has Firefox set as its default browser\", make sure you specify it is 63% of pings, since it is only around 46% of clients. (Apparently users with Firefox Beta 53 set as their default browser submit more main-pings than users who don't).\nProfiles vs Users\nIn the section above you'll notice I said \"clients\" not \"users.\" That is because of all the things we're able to count, users isn't one of them.\nUsers can have multiple Firefox profiles running on the same computer at the same time (like developers).\nUsers can have the same Firefox profile running on several computers on different days of the week (also developers).\nThe only things we can count are pings and clients. Clients we can count because we send a client_id with each ping that uniquely identifies the profile from which it came. This is generally close enough to our idea of \"user\" that we can get away with counting profiles and calling them users, but you may run into some instances where the distinction matters.\nWhen in doubt, be precise. You're counting clients.\nOpt-in vs Opt-out\nWe don't collect the same information from everyone.\nEvery profile that doesn't have Telemetry disabled sends us \"opt-out\" Telemetry. This includes:\n\nNearly everything in the Environment\nSome very specific Histograms, Scalars, and Events that are marked \"releaseChannelCollection\": \"opt-out\"\n\nMost probes are \"opt-in\": we do not get information from them unless the user opts into sending us this information. Users can opt-in in two ways:\n\nUsing Firefox's Options UI to tick the box that gives us permission\nInstalling any pre-release version of Firefox\n\nThe nature of selection bias is such that the population in #1 is useless for analysis. If you want to encourage users to collect good information for us, ask them to install Beta: it's only slightly harder than finding and checking the opt-in check-box in Firefox.\nTrusting Dates\nDon't trust client times.\nAny timestamp recorded by the user is subject to \"clock skew.\" The user's clock can be set (purposefully or accidentally) to any time at all. The nature of SSL certificates tends to keep this within a certain relatively-accurate window, because a user who's clock is too far in the past or too far in the future might confuse certain expiration-date-checking code.\nExamples of client times: crashDate, crashTime, meta/Date, sessionStartDate, subsessionStartDate, profile/creationDate\nExamples of server times you can trust: Timestamp, submission_date\nDate Formats\nNot all dates and times are created equal. Most of the dates and times in Telemetry pings are ISO 8601. Most are full timestamps, though their resolution may differ from being per-second to being per-day.\nThen there's profile/creationDate which is just a number of days since epoch. Like 17177 for the date 2017-01-11.\nTip: To convert profile/creationDate to a usable date in SQL: DATE_ADD('day', profile_created, DATE '1970-01-01')\nIn derived datasets ISO dates are sometimes converted to strings in one of two formats: %Y-%m-%d or %Y%m%d.\nThe date formats for different rows in main_summary are described on the main_summary reference page.\nBuild ids look like dates but aren't. If you take the first eight characters you can use that as a proxy for the day the build was released.\nmetadata/Date is an HTTP Date header in a RFC 7231-compatible format.\nTip: To parse metadata/Date to a usable date in SQL: DATE_PARSE(SUBSTR(client_submission_date, 1, 25), '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%i:%s')\nDelays\nTelemetry data takes a while to get into our hands. The largest data mule in Telemetry is the main-ping. It is (pending bug 1336360) sent at the beginning of a client's next Firefox session. If the user shuts down their Firefox for the weekend, we won't get their Friday data until Monday morning.\nA rule of thumb is data from two days ago is usually fairly representative.\nIf you'd like to read more about this subject and look at pretty graphs, there are a series of blog posts here, here and here.\nPingsender\nPingsender greatly reduces delay in sending pings to Mozilla, but only some types of pings are sent by Pingsender. Bug 1310703 introduced Pingsender for crash pings and was merged in Firefox 54, which hit release on June 13, 2017. Bug 1336360 moved shutdown pings to Pingsender and was merged in Firefox 55, which hit release on August 8, 2017. Bug 1374270 added sending health pings on shutdown via Pingsender and was merged in Firefox 56, which hit release on Sept 28, 2017. Other types of pings are not sent with Pingsender. This is usually okay because Firefox is expected to continue running long enough to send those pings.\nMobile clients do not have Pingsender, so they suffer delay as given in this query.\nSubmission Date\nsubmission_date is the server time at which a ping is received from the client. We use it to\npartition many of our data sets.\nIn bug 1422892 we decided to standardize\non submission_date.\nTL;DR\n\nnot subject to client clock skew\ndoesn't require normalization\ngood for backfill\ngood for daily processing\nand usually good enough\n\n"},"concepts/sql_optimization.html":{"url":"concepts/sql_optimization.html","title":"Optimizing Queries","keywords":"","body":"Optimizing SQL Queries\nAfter you write a query in STMO, you can make big steps to improve performance by\nunderstanding how data is stored, what databases are doing under the covers, and what you can change about your query to\ntake advantage of those two pieces.\nNote that this advice is most relevant for the Presto, Athena, and Presto-Search data sources, as well as Spark SQL\nand Spark notebooks in general.\nTL;DR: What to do for quick improvements\n\nSwitch to Athena\nFilter on a partitioned column† (even if you have a LIMIT)\nSelect the columns you want explicitly (Don't use SELECT *)\nUse approximate algorithms: e.g. approx_distinct(...) instead of COUNT(DISTINCT ...)\n\n† Partitioned columns can be identified in the Schema Explorer in re:dash.\n  They are the first few columns under a table name, and their name is preceded by a [P].\nSome Explanations\nThere are a few key things to understand about our data storage and these databases to\nlearn how to properly optimize queries.\nWhat are these databases?\nThe databases we use are not traditional relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. They are\ndistributed SQL engines, where the data is stored separately from the cluster itself. They\ninclude multiple machines all working together in a coordinated fashion. This is why the\nclusters can get slow when there are lots of competing queries - because the queries are\nsharing resources.\nNote that Athena is serverless, which is why we recommend people use that when they can.\nHow does this impact my queries?\nWhat that means is that multiple machines will be working together to get the result of your\nquery. Because there is more than one machine, we worry a lot about Data Shuffles: when all\nof the machines have to send data around to all of the other machines.\nFor example, consider the following query, which gives the number of rows present for each\nclient_id:\nSELECT client_id, COUNT(*)\nFROM main_summary\nGROUP BY client_id\nThe steps that would happen are this:\n\nEach machine reads a different piece of the data, and parses out the client_id for\neach row. Internally, it then computes the number of rows seen for each client_id,\nbut only for the data that it read.\nEach machine is then given a set of client_ids to aggregate. For example, the first\nmachine may be told to get the count of client1. It will then have to ask every other\nmachine for the total seen for client1. It can then aggregate the total.\nGiven that every client_id has now been aggregated, each machine reports to the coordinator\nthe client_ids that it was responsible for, as well as the count of rows seen for each.\nThe coordinator is responsible for returning the result of the query to the client,\nwhich in our example is STMO.\n\nA similar process happens on data joins, where different machines are told to join on \ndifferent keys. In that case, data from both tables needs to be shuffled to every machine.\nWhy do we have multiple databases? Why not use Athena for everything?\nGreat question! Presto is something we control, and can upgrade it at-will. Athena is currently\na serverless version of Presto, and as such doesn't have all of the bells and whistles. For example,\nit doesn't support lambda expressions or\nUDFs, the latter of which we use in the Client Count Daily dataset.\nKey Takeaways\n\nUse Athena, since it doesn't have the resource constraints that Presto or Spark do.\nUse LIMIT. At the end of a query all the data needs to be sent to a single machine, using LIMIT\nwill reduce that amount and possible prevent an out of memory situation.\nUse approximate algorithms. These mean less data needs to be shuffled, since we can use\nprobabilistic data structures instead of the raw data itself.\nSpecify large tables first in a JOIN operation. In this case, small tables can be sent to\nevery machine, eliminating one data shuffle operation. Note that Spark supports a broadcast\ncommand explicitly.\n\nHow is the data stored?\nThe data is stored in columnar format. Let's try and understand that with an example.\nTraditional Row Stores\nConsider a completely normal CSV file, which is actually an example of a row store.\nname,age,height\n\"Ted\",27,6.0\n\"Emmanuel\",45,5.9\n\"Cadence\",5,3.5\nWhen this data is stored to disk, you could read an entire record in a consecutive order. For example if\nthe first \" was stored at block 1 on disk, then a sequential scan from 1 will give the first row of\ndata: \"ted\",27,6.0. Keep scanning and you'll get \\n\"Emm... and so on.\nSo for the above, the following query will be fast:\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE name == 'Ted'\nSince the database can just scan the first row of data. However, the following is more difficult:\nSELECT name\nFROM people\nNow the database has to read all of the rows, and then pick out the name column. This is a lot\nmore overhead!\nColumnar Stores\nColumnar turns the data sideways. For example, we can make a columnar version of the above data,\nand still store it in CSV:\nname,\"Ted\",\"Emmanuel\",\"Cadence\"\nage,27,45,5\nheight,6.0,5.9,3.5\nPretty easy! Now let's consider how we can query the data when it's stored this way.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE name == \"ted\"\nThis query is pretty hard! We have to read all of the data now, because the\n(name, age, height) isn't stored together.\nNow let's consider our other query:\nSELECT name\nFROM people\nSuddenly, this is easy! We don't have to check in as many places for data,\nwe can just read the first few blocks of disks sequentially.\nData Partitions\nWe can improve performance even further by taking advantage of partitions. These are entire files of data\nthat share a value for a column. So for example, if everyone in the people table lived in DE, then we\ncould add that to the filename: /country=DE/people.csv.\nFrom there, our query engine would have to know how to read that path, and understand that it's telling us\nthat all of those people share a country. So if we were to query for this:\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE country == 'US'\nThe database wouldn't have to even read the file! It could just look at the path and realize there was\nnothing of interest.\nOur tables are often partitioned by date, e.g. submission_date_s3.\nKey Takeaways\n\nLimit queries to a specific few columns you need, to reduce the amount of data that has to be read\nFilter on partitions to prune down the data you need\n\n"},"concepts/review.html":{"url":"concepts/review.html","title":"Getting Review","keywords":"","body":"Getting Analysis Review\nThe current process for getting analysis review has not been optimized.\nIf you run into problems, feel free to ask in the #datapipeline channel on IRC.\nTable of Contents\n\n\nFinding a Reviewer\nData Reviewers\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\nRTMO\nStart a Repository\nWhere to store the package\nnbconvert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a Reviewer\nThere are two major types of review for most analyses:\nData review and Methodology review.\nA data reviewer has expert understanding of the dataset your analysis is based upon.\nDuring data review, your reviewer will try to identify\nany issues with your analysis that come from misapplying the data.\nFor example, sampling issues or data collection oddities.\nMethodology review primarily covers statistical concepts.\nFor example, if you're training regressions, forecasting data, or doing complex\nstatistical tests, you should probably get Methodology review.\nMany (most?) analyses at Mozilla use simple aggregations and little to no statistical inference.\nThese analyses only require data review.\nAccordingly, we suggest you first find a data reviewer for your analysis.\nYour data reviewer will tell you if you should get methodology review\nand will help you find a reviewer.\nData Reviewers\nTo get review for your analysis,\ncontact one of the data reviewers listed for the dataset your analysis is based upon:\n\n\n\nDataset\nReviewers\n\n\n\n\nLongitudinal\n\n\n\nCross Sectional\n\n\n\nMain Summary\n\n\n\nCrash Summary\n\n\n\nCrash Aggregate\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSync Summary\n\n\n\nAddons\n\n\n\nClient Count Daily\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\nIt's difficult to review Jupyter notebooks on Github.\nThe notebook is stored as a JSON object, with python code stored in strings.\nThis makes commenting on particular lines very difficult.\nBecause the output is stored next to the code,\nit's also very difficult to review the diff for a given notebook.\nRTMO\nFor simple notebooks, the best way to get review is through the\nknowledge repo.\nThe knowledge repo renders your Jupyter notebooks to markdown\nwhile keeping the original source code next to the document.\nThis gives your reviewer an easy-to-review markdown file.\nYour analysis will also be available at\nRTMO.\nThis will aid discoverability and help others find your analysis.\nNote that RTMO is public so your analysis will also be public.\nStart a Repository\nNotebooks are great for presenting information,\nbut are not a good medium for storing code.\nIf your notebook contains complicated logic or a significant amount of custom code,\nyou should consider moving most of the logic to a python package.\nYour reviewer may ask you for tests,\nwhich also requires moving the code out of a notebook.\nWhere to store the package\nThe data platform team maintains a python repository of analyses and ETL called\npython_mozetl.\nFeel free to file a pull request against that repository.\nYour reviewer will provide analysis review during the code review.\nYou'll need review for each commit to python_mozetl's master branch.\nIf you are still prototyping your job but want to move out of a Jupyter notebook,\ntake a look at\ncookiecutter-python-etl.\nThis tool will help you configure a new python repository\nso you can hack quickly without getting review.\nnbconvert\nThe easiest way to get your code out of a Jupyter notebook\nis to use nbconvert command from Jupyter.\nIf you have a notebook called analysis.ipynb\nyou can dump your analysis to a python script using the following command:\njupyter nbconvert --to python analysis.ipynb\n\nYou'll need to clean up some formatting in the resulting analysis.py file,\nbut most of the work has been done for you.\n"},"datasets/new_data.html":{"url":"datasets/new_data.html","title":"Collecting New Data","keywords":"","body":"Collecting New Data\nGuidelines\nFor information about what sorts of data may be collected,\nand for information on getting a data collection request reviewed,\nplease read the Data Collection Guidelines.\nMechanics\nThe mechanics of how to instrument new data collection in Firefox are covered in\nAdding a new Telemetry probe.\nFor non-Telemetry data collection, we have a mechanism for streamlining\ningestion of structured (JSON) data that utilizes the same underlying\ninfrastructure.

Each probe must declare the collection policy it conforms to: either release or prerelease. When adding a new measurement data-reviewers carefully inspect the probe and eventually approve the requested collection policy:\n\nRelease data is collected from all Firefox users.\nPrerelease data is collected from users on Firefox Nightly and Beta channels.\n\nUsers may choose to turn the data collection off in preferences.\nA session begins when Firefox starts up and ends when it shuts down. As a session could be long-running and last weeks, it gets sliced into smaller logical units called subsessions. Each subsession generates a batch of data containing the current state of all probes collected so far, i.e. a main ping, which is sent to our servers. The main ping is just one of the many ping types we support. Developers can create their own ping types if needed.\nPings are submitted via an API that performs a HTTP POST request to our edge servers. If a ping fails to successfully submit (e.g. because of missing internet connection), Firefox will store the ping on disk and retry to send it until the maximum ping age is exceeded.\nKafka\nHTTP submissions coming in from the wild hit a load balancer and then an NGINX module. The module accepts data via a HTTP request which it wraps in a Hindsight protobuf message and forwards to two places: a Kafka cluster and a short-lived S3 bucket (landfill) which acts as a fail-safe in case there is a processing error and/or data loss within the rest of the pipeline. The deployment scripts and configuration files of NGINX and Kafka live in a private repository.\nThe data from Kafka is read from the Complex Event Processors (CEP) and the Data Warehouse Loader (DWL), both of which use Hindsight.\nHindsight\nHindsight, an open source stream processing software system developed by Mozilla as Heka’s successor, is useful for a wide variety of different tasks, such as:\n\nconverting data from one format to another;\nshipping data from one location to another;\nperforming real time analysis, graphing, and anomaly detection.\n\nHindsight’s core is a lightweight data processing kernel written in C that controls a set of Lua plugins executed inside a sandbox.\nThe CEP are custom plugins that are created, configured and deployed from an UI which produce real-time plots like the number of pings matching a certain criteria.  Mozilla employees can access the UI and create/deploy their own custom plugin in real-time without interfering with other plugins running.\n\nThe DWL is composed of a set of plugins that transform, convert & finally shovel pings into S3 for long term storage. In the specific case of Telemetry data, an input plugin reads pings from Kafka, pre-processes them and sends batches to S3, our data lake, for long term storage. The data is compressed and partitioned by a set of dimensions, like date and application.\nThe data has traditionally been serialized to Protobuf sequence files which contain some nasty “free-form” JSON fields. Hindsight gained recently the ability to dump data directly in Parquet form though.\nThe deployment scripts and configuration files of the CEP & DWL live in a private repository.\nSpark\nOnce the data reaches our data lake on S3 it can be processed with Spark. We provide a portal (ATMO) that allows Mozilla employees to create their own Spark cluster pre-loaded with a set of libraries & tools, like Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas etc., and an API to conveniently read data stored in Protobuf form on S3 in a Spark RDD using a ORM-like interface. Behind the scenes we use EMR to create Spark clusters, which are then monitored by ATMO.\n\nATMO is mainly used to write custom analyses; since our users aren’t necessary data engineers/scientists we chose Python as the main supported language to interface with Spark. From ATMO it’s also possible to schedule periodic notebook runs and inspect the results from a web UI.\nAs mentioned earlier, most of our data lake contains data serialized to Protobuf with free-form JSON fields. Needless to say, parsing JSON is terribly slow when ingesting Terabytes of data per day. A set of ETL jobs, written in Scala by Data Engineers and scheduled with Airflow, create Parquet views of our raw data.

The service is mainly used by TMO, a dashboard that visualizes distributions and time-series, and Cerberus, an anomaly detection tool that detects and alerts developers of changes in the distributions. Originally the sole purpose of the Telemetry pipeline was to feed data into this dashboard but in time its scope and flexibility grew to support more general use-cases.\n\nPresto & re:dash\nWe maintain a couple of Presto clusters and a centralized Hive metastore to query Parquet data with SQL. The Hive metastore provides an universal view of our Parquet dataset to both Spark and Presto clusters.\nPresto, and other databases, are behind a re:dash service (STMO) which provides a convenient & powerful interface to query SQL engines and build dashboards that can be shared within the company. Mozilla maintains its own fork of re:dash to iterate quickly on new features, but as good open source citizen we push our changes upstream.\n\nIs that it?\nNo, not really. If you want to read more, check out this article. For example, the DWL pushes some of the Telemetry data to Redshift and other tools that satisfy more niche needs. The pipeline ingests logs from services as well and there are many specialized dashboards out there I haven’t mentioned. We also use Zeppelin as a means to create interactive data analysis notebooks that supports Spark, SQL, Scala and more.\nThere is a vast ecosystem of tools for processing data at scale, each with their pros & cons. The pipeline grew organically and we added new tools as new use-cases came up that we couldn’t solve with our existing stack. There are still scars left from that growth though which require some effort to get rid of, like ingesting data from schema-less format.\n"},"concepts/pipeline/data_pipeline_detail.html":{"url":"concepts/pipeline/data_pipeline_detail.html","title":"In-depth Data Pipeline Detail","keywords":"","body":"A Detailed Look at the Data Platform\nFor a more gentle introduction to the data platform, please read the Pipeline Overview article.\nThis article goes into more depth about the architecture and flow of data in the platform.\nThe Entire Platform\nThe full detail of the platform can get quite complex, but at a high level the structure is fairly simple.\n\ngraph LR\n  Producers[Data Producers] --> Ingestion\n  Ingestion --> Storage[Long-term Storage]\n  Ingestion --> Stream[Stream Processing]\n  Stream --> Storage\n  Batch[Batch Processing] --> Storage\n  Storage --> Batch\n  Self[Self Serve] -.- Stream\n  Self -.- Batch\n  Stream -.-> Visualization\n  Batch -.-> Visualization\n  Stream --> Export\n  Batch --> Export\n\n\nEach of these high-level parts of the platform are described in more detail below.\nData Producers\nBy far most data handled by the Data Platform is produced by Firefox. There are other producers, though, and the eventual aim is to generalize data production using a client SDK or set of standard tools.\nMost data is submitted via HTTP POST, but data is also produced in the form of service logs and statsd messages.\nIf you would like to locally test a new data producer, the gzipServer project provides a simplified server that makes it easy to inspect submitted messages.\nIngestion\n\ngraph LR\n  subgraph HTTP\n    tee\n    lb[Load Balancer]\n    mozingest\n  end\n  subgraph Kafka\n    kafka_unvalidated[Kafka unvalidated]\n    kafka_validated[Kafka validated]\n    zookeeper[ZooKeeper] -.- kafka_unvalidated\n    zookeeper -.- kafka_validated\n  end\n  subgraph Storage\n    s3_heka[S3 Heka Protobuf Storage]\n    s3_parquet[S3 Parquet Storage]\n  end\n  subgraph Data Producers\n    Firefox --> lb\n    more_producers[Other Producers] --> lb\n  end\n\n  lb --> tee\n  tee --> mozingest\n  mozingest --> kafka_unvalidated\n  mozingest --> Landfill\n  kafka_unvalidated --> dwl[Data Store Loader]\n  kafka_validated --> cep[Hindsight CEP]\n  kafka_validated --> sparkstreaming[Spark Streaming]\n  Schemas -.->|validation| dwl\n  dwl --> kafka_validated\n  dwl --> s3_heka\n  dwl --> s3_parquet\n  sparkstreaming --> s3_parquet\n\n\nData arrives as an HTTP POST of an optionally gzipped payload of JSON. See the common Edge Server specification for details.\nSubmissions hit a load balancer which handles the SSL connection, then forwards to a \"tee\" server, which may direct some or all submissions to alternate backends. In the past, the tee was used to manage the cutover between different versions of the backend infrastructure. It is implemented as an OpenResty plugin.\nFrom there, the mozingest HTTP Server receives submissions from the tee and batches and stores data durably on Amazon S3 as a fail-safe (we call this \"Landfill\"). Data is then passed along via Kafka for validation and further processing. If there is a problem with decoding, validation, or any of the code described in the rest of this section, data can be re-processed from this fail-safe store. The mozingest server is implemented as an nginx module.\nValidation, at a minimum, ensures that a payload is valid JSON (possibly compressed). Many document types also have a JSONSchema specification, and are further validated against that.\nInvalid messages are redirected to a separate \"errors\" stream for debugging and inspection.\nValid messages proceed for further decoding and processing. This involves things like doing GeoIP lookup and discarding the IP address, and attaching some HTTP header info as annotated metadata.\nValidated and annotated messages become available for stream processing.\nThey are also batched and stored durably for later batch processing and ad-hoc querying.\nSee also the \"generic ingestion\" proposal which aims to make ingestion, validation, storage, and querying available as self-serve for platform users.\nData flow for valid submissions\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Fx as Firefox\n    participant lb as Load Balancer\n    participant mi as mozingest\n    participant lf as Landfill\n    participant k as Kafka\n    participant dwl as Data Store Loader\n    participant dl as Data Lake\n\n    Fx->>lb: HTTPS POST\n    lb->>mi: forward\n    mi-->>lf: failsafe store\n    mi->>k: enqueue\n    k->>dwl: validate, decode\n    dwl->>k: enqueue validated\n    dwl->>dl: store durably\n\n\nOther ingestion methods\nHindsight is used for ingestion of logs from applications and services, it supports parsing of log lines and appending similar metadata as the HTTP ingestion above (timestamp, source, and so on).\nStatsd messages are ingested in the usual way.\nStorage\n\ngraph TD\n  subgraph RDBMS\n    PostgreSQL\n    Redshift\n    MySQL\n    BigQuery\n  end\n  subgraph NoSQL\n    DynamoDB\n  end\n  subgraph S3\n    landfill[Landfill]\n    s3_heka[Heka Data Lake]\n    s3_parquet[Parquet Data Lake]\n    s3_analysis[Analysis Outputs]\n    s3_public[Public Outputs]\n  end\n\n  Ingestion --> s3_heka\n  Ingestion --> s3_parquet\n  Ingestion --> landfill\n  Ingestion -.-> stream[Stream Processing]\n  stream --> s3_parquet\n  batch[Batch Processing] --> s3_parquet\n  batch --> PostgreSQL\n  batch --> DynamoDB\n  batch --> s3_public\n  selfserve[Self Serve] --> s3_analysis\n  s3_analysis --> selfserve\n  Hive -->|Presto| redash[Re:dash]\n  PostgreSQL --> redash\n  Redshift --> redash\n  MySQL --> redash\n  BigQuery --> redash\n\n  s3_parquet -.- Hive\n\n\nAmazon S3 forms the backbone of the platform storage layer. The primary format used in the Data Lake is parquet, which is a strongly typed columnar storage format that can easily be read and written by Spark, as well as being compatible with SQL interfaces such as Hive and Presto. Some data is also stored in Heka-framed protobuf format. This custom format is usually reserved for data where we do not have a complete JSONSchema specification.\nUsing S3 for storage avoids the need for an always-on cluster, which means that data at rest is inexpensive. S3 also makes it very easy to automatically expire (delete) objects after a certain period of time, which is helpful for implementing data retention policies.\nOnce written to S3, the data is typically treated as immutable - data is not appended to existing files, nor is data normally updated in place. The exception here is when data is back-filled, in which case previous data may be overwritten.\nThere are a number of other types of storage used for more specialized applications, including relational databases (such as PostgreSQL for the Telemetry Aggregates) and NoSQL databases (DynamoDB is used for a backing store for the TAAR project). Reading data from a variety of RDBMS sources is also supported via Re:dash.\nThe data stored in Heka format is readable from Spark using libraries in Scala or Python.\nParquet data can be read and written natively from Spark, and many datasets are indexed in a Hive Metastore, making them available through a SQL interface on Re:dash and in notebooks via Spark SQL. Many other SQL data sources are also made available via Re:dash, see this article for more information on accessing data using SQL.\nThere is a separate data store for self-serve Analysis Outputs, intended to keep ad-hoc, temporary data out of the Data Lake. This is implemented as a separate S3 location, with personal output locations prefixed with each person's user id, similar to the layout of the /home directory on a Unix system. See the Working with Parquet data cookbook for more details.\nAnalysis outputs can also be made public using the Public Outputs bucket. This is a web-accessible S3 location for powering public dashboards. This public data is available at https://analysis-output.telemetry.mozilla.org//data/.\nStream Processing\nStream processing is done using Hindsight and Spark Streaming.\nHindsight allows you to run plugins written in Lua inside a sandbox. This gives a safe, performant way to do self-serve streaming analysis. See this article for an introduction. Hindsight plugins do the initial data validation and decoding, as well as writing out to long-term storage in both Heka-framed protobuf and parquet forms.\nSpark Streaming is used to read from Kafka and perform low-latency ETL and aggregation tasks. These aggregates are currently used by Mission Control and are also available for querying via Re:dash.\nBatch Processing\nBatch processing is done using Spark. Production ETL code is written in both Python and Scala.\nThere are Python and Scala libraries for reading data from the Data Lake in Heka-framed protobuf form, though it is much easier and more performant to make use of a derived dataset whenever possible.\nDatasets in parquet format can be read natively by Spark, either using Spark SQL or by reading data directly from S3.\nData produced by production jobs go into the Data Lake, while output from ad-hoc jobs go into Analysis Outputs.\nJob scheduling and dependency management is done using Airflow. Most jobs run once a day, processing data from \"yesterday\" on each run. A typical job launches a cluster, which fetches the specified ETL code as part of its bootstrap on startup, runs the ETL code, then shuts down upon completion. If something goes wrong, a job may time out or fail, and in this case it is retried automatically.\nSelf Serve Data Analysis\n\ngraph TD\n  subgraph Storage\n    lake[Data Lake]\n    s3_output_public[Public Outputs]\n    s3_output_private[Analysis Outputs]\n  end\n  subgraph ATMO\n    Jupyter -->|runs on| emr_cluster[Ad hoc EMR Cluster]\n    Zeppelin -->|runs on| emr_cluster\n    atmo_service[ATMO Service] -->|launch| emr_cluster\n    atmo_service -->|schedule| emr_job[fa:fa-clock-o Scheduled EMR Job]\n    emr_cluster -->|mount| EFS\n    emr_cluster -->|read + write| lake\n    emr_job -->|read + write| s3_output_public\n    emr_job -->|read + write| s3_output_private\n  end\n  subgraph STMO\n    redash[Re:dash] -->|read| lake\n  end\n  subgraph TMO\n    evo[Evolution Dashboard]\n    histo[Histogram Dashboard]\n    agg[Telemetry Aggregates]\n    evo -.- agg\n    histo -.- agg\n  end\n  subgraph Databricks\n    db_notebook[Notebook]\n    db_notebook -->|read + write| lake\n  end\n\n\nMost of the data analysis tooling has been developed with the goal of being \"self-serve\". This means that people should be able to access and analyze data on their own, without involving data engineers or operations. Thus can data access scale beyond a small set of people with specialized knowledge of the entire pipeline.\nThe use of these self-serve tools is described in the Getting Started article. This section focuses on how these tools integrate with the platform infrastructure.\nATMO: Spark Analysis\nATMO is a service for managing Spark clusters for data analysis. Clusters can be launched on demand, or can be scheduled to run a job on an ongoing basis. These clusters can read from the Data Lake described in the Storage section above, and can write results to either public (web-accessible) or private output locations.\nJupyter or Zeppelin notebooks are the usual interface to getting work done using a cluster, though you get full SSH access to the cluster.\nClusters launched via ATMO are automatically killed after a user-defined period of time (by default, 8 hours), though their lifetime can be extended as needed. Each cluster has a user-specific EFS volume mounted on the /home/hadoop directory, which means that data stored locally on the cluster persists from one cluster to the next. This volume is shared by all clusters launched by a given ATMO user.\nSTMO: SQL Analysis\nSTMO is a customized Re:dash installation that provides self-serve access to a a variety of different datasets. From here, you can query data in the Parquet Data Lake as well as various RDBMS data sources.\nSTMO interfaces with the data lake using both Presto and Amazon Athena. Each has its own data source in Re:dash. Since Athena does not support user-defined functions, datasets with HyperLogLog columns, such as client_count_daily, are only available via Presto..\nDifferent Data Sources in STMO connect to different backends, and each backend might use a slightly different flavor of SQL. You should find a link to the documentation for the expected SQL variant next to the Data Sources list.\nQueries can be run just once, or scheduled to run periodically to keep data up-to-date.\nThere is a command-line interface to STMO called St. Mocli, if you prefer writing SQL using your own editor and tools.\nDatabricks: Managed Spark Analysis\nOur Databricks instance (see Databricks docs) offers another notebook interface for doing analysis in Scala, SQL, Python and R.\nDatabricks provides an always-on shared server which is nice for quick data investigations. ATMO clusters take some time to start up, usually on the order of tens of minutes. The shared server allows you to avoid this start-up cost. Prefer ATMO for heavy analyses since you will have dedicated resources.\nTMO: Aggregate Graphs\nTMO provides easy visualizations of histogram and scalar measures over time. Time can be in terms of either builds or submission dates. This is the most convenient interface to the Telemetry data, as it does not require any custom code.\nVisualization\nThere are a number of visualization libraries and tools being used to display data.\nTMO Dashboards\nThe landing page at telemetry.mozilla.org is a good place to look for existing graphs, notably the measurement dashboard which gives a lot of information about histogram and scalar measures collected on pre-release channels.\nNotebooks\nUse of interactive notebooks has become a standard in the industry, and Mozilla makes heavy use of this approach. ATMO makes it easy to run, share, and schedule Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks.\nDatabricks notebooks are also an option.\nOthers\nRe:dash lets you query the data using SQL, but it also supports a number of useful visualizations.\nHindsight's web interface has the ability to visualize time-series data.\nMission Control gives a low-latency view into release health.\nMany bespoke visualizations are built using the Metrics Graphics library as a display layer.\nMonitoring and Alerting\nThere are multiple layers of monitoring and alerting.\nAt a low level, the system is monitored to ensure that it is functioning as expected. This includes things like machine-level resources (network capacity, disk space, available RAM, CPU load) which are typically monitored using DataDog.\nNext, we monitor the \"transport\" functionality of the system. This includes monitoring incoming submission rates, payload sizes, traffic patterns, schema validation failure rates, and alerting if anomalies are detected. This type of anomaly detection and alerting is handled by Hindsight.\nOnce data has been safely ingested and stored, we run some automatic regression detection on all Telemetry histogram measures using Cerberus. This code looks for changes in the distribution of a measure, and emails probe owners if a significant change is observed.\nProduction ETL jobs are run via Airflow, which monitors batch job progress and alerts if there are failures in any job. Self-serve batch jobs run via ATMO also generate alerts upon failure.\nScheduled Re:dash queries may also be configured to generate alerts, which is used to monitor the last-mile user facing status of derived datasets. Re:dash may also be used to monitor and alert on high-level characteristics of the data, or really anything you can think of.\nData Exports\nData is exported from the pipeline to a few other tools and systems. Examples include integration with Amplitude for mobile and product analytics, publishing reports and visualizations to the Mozilla Data Collective, and shipping data to other parts of the Mozilla organization.\nThere are also a few data sets which are made publicly available, such as the Firefox Hardware Report.\nBringing it all together\nFinally, here is a more detailed view of the entire platform. Some connections are omitted for clarity.\n\ngraph LR\n subgraph Data Producers\n  Firefox\n  more_producers[...]\n end\n subgraph Storage\n  Landfill\n  warehouse_heka[Heka Data Lake]\n  warehouse_parquet[Parquet Data Lake]\n  warehouse_analysis[Analysis Outputs]\n  PostgreSQL\n  Redshift\n  MySQL\n  hive[Hive] -.- warehouse_parquet\n end\n subgraph Stream Processing\n  cep[Hindsight Streaming]\n  dwl[Data Store Loader] --> warehouse_heka\n  dwl --> warehouse_parquet\n  sparkstreaming[Spark Streaming] --> warehouse_parquet\n end\n subgraph Ingestion\n  Firefox --> lb[Load Balancer]\n  more_producers --> lb\n  lb --> tee\n  tee --> mozingest\n  mozingest --> kafka\n  mozingest --> Landfill\n  ZooKeeper -.- kafka[Kafka]\n  kafka --> dwl\n  kafka --> cep\n  kafka --> sparkstreaming\n end\n subgraph Batch Processing\n  Airflow -.->|spark|tbv[telemetry-batch-view]\n  Airflow -.->|spark|python_mozetl\n  warehouse_heka --> tbv\n  warehouse_parquet --> tbv\n  warehouse_heka --> python_mozetl\n  warehouse_parquet --> python_mozetl\n  tmo_agg[Telemetry Aggregates]\n end\n subgraph Visualization\n  Hindsight\n  Jupyter\n  Zeppelin\n  TMO\n  redash_graphs[Re:dash]\n  MissionControl\n  bespoke_viz[Bespoke Viz]\n end\n subgraph Export\n  tbv --> Amplitude\n  sparkstreaming --> Amplitude\n end\n subgraph Self Serve\n  redash[Re:dash] -.-> Presto\n  Presto --> hive\n  redash -.-> Athena\n  Athena --> hive\n  ATMO -.-> spcluster[Spark Cluster]\n  warehouse_heka --> spcluster\n  warehouse_parquet --> spcluster\n  spcluster --> warehouse_analysis\n end\n Schemas -.->|validation| dwl\n\n\n\n"},"concepts/pipeline/http_edge_spec.html":{"url":"concepts/pipeline/http_edge_spec.html","title":"HTTP Edge Server Specification","keywords":"","body":"HTTP Edge Server Specification\nThis document specifies the behavior of the server that accepts submissions from\nany HTTP client e.g. Firefox telemetry.\nThe original implementation of the HTTP Edge Server was tracked in\nBug 1129222.\nGeneral Data Flow\nHTTP submissions come in from the wild, hit a load balancer, then optionally an\nNginx proxy, then the HTTP Edge Server described in this document.

This is used for events when additional richer context is needed.\n\nSee also the Firefox Telemetry documentation.\nEvent data collection\nFirefox event collection\nTo collect this event data in Firefox there are different APIs in Firefox, all addressing different\nuse cases:\n\nThe Telemetry event API\nallows easy recording of events from Firefox code.\nThe dynamic event API\nallows code from Mozilla addons to record new events into Telemetry without shipping Firefox\ncode.\nThe Telemetry extension API (work in progress)\nwill allow Mozilla extensions to record new events into Telemetry.\nThe Hybrid-content API\nallows specific white-listed Mozilla content code to record new events into Telemetry.\n\nFor all these APIs, events will get sent to the pipeline through the\nmain ping,\nwith a hard limit of 500 events per ping.\nIn the future, Firefox events will be sent through a separate events ping, removing the hard limit.\nAs of Firefox 61, all events recorded through these APIs are automatically counted in scalars.\nFinally, custom pings\ncan follow the event data format and potentially connect to the existing tooling with some integration work.\nMobile event collection\nMobile events data primarily flows through the mobile events ping (ping schema), from e.g. Firefox iOS, Firefox for Fire TV and Rocket.\nCurrently we also collect event data from Firefox Focus through the focus-events ping,\nusing the telemetry-ios and\ntelemetry-android libraries.\nDatasets\nOn the pipeline side, the event data is made available in different datasets:\n\nmain_summary has a row for each main ping and includes\nits event payload.\nevents contains a row for each event received. See this sample query.\ntelemetry_mobile_event_parquet contains a row for each mobile event ping. See this sample query.\nfocus_events_longitudinal currently contains events from Firefox Focus.\n\nData tooling\nThe above datasets are all accessible through Re:dash and Spark jobs.\nFor product analytics based on event data, we have Amplitude\n(hosted by the IT data team). We can connect our event data sources data to Amplitude.\nWe have an active connector to Amplitude for mobile events, which can push event data over\ndaily. For Firefox Desktop events this will be available soon.\n"},"tools/interfaces.html":{"url":"tools/interfaces.html","title":"Analysis Interfaces","keywords":"","body":"Mozilla Firefox Data Analysis Tools\nThis is a starting point for making sense of (and gaining access to) all of the\nFirefox-related data analysis tools.

Users can get help on #databricks\nchannel on IRC and are advised to join the \ndatabricks-discuss@mozilla.com group.\ntelemetry.mozilla.org (TMO)\nOur telemetry.mozilla.org (TMO) site is the\n'venerable standby' of Firefox telemetry analysis tools. It uses aggregate\ntelemetry data (as opposed to the collated data sets that are exposed to most\nof the other tools) so it provides less latency than most but is unsuitable for\nexamining at the individual client level. It provides a powerful UI that allows\nfor sophisticated ad-hoc analysis without the need for any specialized\nprogramming skills, but with so many options the UI can be a bit intimidating\nfor novice users.\nDistribution Viewer\nDistribution Viewer is a simple tool\nthat provides a set of cumulative distribution\ngraphs\nfor a pre-specified selection of Firefox user metrics. These metrics are\nextracted from a 1% sample of the clientIds from Firefox Telemetry. These plots\nwill allow you to understand how values of different metrics are spread out\namong our population of users rather than just using a one number summary (such\nas a mean or median). By viewing the entire distribution, you can get a sense\nof the importance of behavior at the extremes as well as anomalies within the\npopulation that might indicate interesting behavior. Very simple to use (no\nprogramming required) and able to provide interesting insights, but not usually\nsuitable for ad-hoc analysis.\nReal Time / CEP\nThe \"real time\" or \"complex event processing\" (CEP)\nsystem is part of the ingestion\ninfrastructure that processes all of our Firefox telemetry data. It provides\nextremely low latency access to the data as it's flowing through our ingestion\nsystem on its way to long term storage. As a CEP system, it is unlike the rest\nof our analysis tools in that it is up to the analyst to specify and maintain\nstate from the data that is flowing; it is non-trivial to revisit older data\nthat has already passed through the system. The CEP is very powerful, allowing\nfor sophisticated monitoring, alerting, reporting, and dashboarding. Developing\nnew analysis plugins requires knowledge of the Lua programming language,\nrelevant APIs, and a custom filter configuration syntax.

Please keep in mind\nto use resources sparingly; use a single worker to write and\ndebug your job.\nUpload your SSH public key.\n\n\nClick “Submit”.\nA cluster will be launched on AWS pre-configured with Spark, Jupyter\nand some handy data analysis libraries like pandas and matplotlib.\n\nOnce the cluster is ready, you can tunnel Jupyter through SSH by\nfollowing the instructions on the dashboard.\nFor example:\nssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -L 8888:localhost:8888 hadoop@ec2-54-70-129-221.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\nFinally, you can launch Jupyter in Firefox by visiting http://localhost:8888.\nThe Python Jupyter Notebook\nWhen you access http://localhost:8888, two example Jupyter notebooks\nare available to peruse.\nStarting out, we recommend looking through the\nTelemetry Hello World\nnotebook.\nIt gives a nice overview of Jupyter and analyzing telemetry data using PySpark and the RDD API.\nUsing Jupyter\nJupyter Notebooks contain a series of cells.\nEach cell contains code or markdown.\nTo switch between the two, use the drop-down at the top.\nTo run a cell, use shift-enter;\nthis either compiles the markdown or runs the code.\nTo create new cell, select Insert -> Insert Cell Below.\nA cell can output text or plots.\nTo output plots inlined with the cell,\nrun %pylab inline, usually below your import statements:\nThe notebook is setup to work with Spark. See the \"Using Spark\" section\nfor more information.\nSchedule a periodic job\nScheduled Spark jobs allow a Jupyter notebook to be updated consistently,\nmaking a nice and easy-to-use dashboard.\nTo schedule a Spark job:\n\nVisit the analysis provisioning dashboard at\nhttps://analysis.telemetry.mozilla.org and sign in\nClick “Schedule a Spark Job”\nEnter some details:\nThe “Job Name” field should be a short descriptive name, like\n“chromehangs analysis”.\nUpload your Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.\nSet the number of workers of the cluster in the “Cluster Size”\nfield.\nSet a schedule frequency using the remaining fields.\n\n\n\nNow, the notebook will be updated automatically and the results can be\neasily shared. Furthermore, all files stored in the notebook's local\nworking directory at the end of the job will be automatically uploaded\nto S3, which comes in handy for simple ETL workloads for example.\nFor reference, see\nSimple Dashboard with Scheduled Spark Jobs and Plotly.\nSharing a Notebook\nJupyter notebooks can be shared in a few different ways.\nSharing a Static Notebook\nAn easy way to share is using a gist on Github.\n\nDownload file as .ipynb\nUpload to a gist on gist.github.com\nEnter the gist URL at Jupyter nbviewer\nShare with your colleagues!\n\nSharing a Scheduled Notebook\nSetup your scheduled notebook. After it's run, do the following:\n\nGo to the \"Schedule a Spark job\" tab in ATMO\nGet the URL for the notebook (under 'Currently Scheduled Jobs')\nPaste that URL into Jupyter nbviewer\n\nZeppelin Notebooks\nWe also have support for Apache Zeppelin\nnotebooks. The notebook server for that is running on port 8890, so you\ncan connect to it just by tunnelling the port (instead of port 8888 for\nJupyter). For example:\nssh -i \\~/.ssh/id\\_rsa -L 8890:localhost:8890\nhadoop@ec2-54-70-129-221.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\nUsing Spark\nSpark is a general-purpose cluster computing system - it allows users to\nrun general execution graphs. APIs are available in Python, Scala, and\nJava. The Jupyter notebook utilizes the Python API. In a nutshell, it\nprovides a way to run functional code (e.g. map, reduce, etc.) on large,\ndistributed data.\nCheck out\nSpark Best Practices\nfor tips on using Spark to its full capabilities.\nSparkContext (sc)\nAccess to the Spark API is provided through SparkContext. In the Jupyter\nnotebook, this is the sc object. For example, to create a\ndistributed RDD of monotonically increasing numbers 1-1000:\nnumbers = range(1000)\n# no need to initialize sc in the Jupyter notebook\nnumsRdd = sc.parallelize(numbers)\nnums.take(10) #no guaranteed order\n\nSpark RDD\nThe Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is Spark's basic data structure.\nThe operations that are performed on these structures are distributed to\nthe cluster. Only certain actions (such as collect() or take(N)) pull an\nRDD in locally.\nRDD's are nice because there is no imposed schema - whatever they\ncontain, they distribute around the cluster. Additionally, RDD's can be\ncached in memory, which can greatly improve performance of some\nalgorithms that need access to data over and over again.\nAdditionally, RDD operations are all part of a directed, acyclic graph.\nThis gives increased redundancy, since Spark is always able to recreate\nan RDD from the base data (by rerunning the graph), but also provides\nlazy evaluation. No computation is performed while an RDD is just being\ntransformed (a la map), but when an action is taken (e.g. reduce, take)\nthe entire computation graph is evaluated. Continuing from our previous\nexample, the following gives some of the peaks of a sin wave:\nimport numpy as np\n#no computation is performed on the following line!\nsin_values = numsRdd.map(lambda x : np.float(x) / 10).map(lambda x : (x, np.sin(x)))\n#now the entire computation graph is evaluated\nsin_values.takeOrdered(5, lambda x : -x[1])\n\nFor jumping into working with Spark RDD's, we recommend reading the\nSpark Programming Guide.\nSpark SQL and Spark DataFrames/Datasets\nSpark also supports traditional SQL, along with special data structures\nthat require schemas. The Spark SQL API can be accessed with the\nspark object. For example:\nlongitudinal = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM longitudinal')\ncreates a DataFrame that contains all the longitudinal data. A Spark\nDataFrame is essentially a distributed table, a la Pandas or R\nDataFrames. Under the covers they are an RDD of Row objects, and thus\nthe entirety of the RDD API is available for DataFrames, as well as a\nDataFrame specific API. For example, a SQL-like way to get the count of\na specific OS:\nlongitudinal.select(\"os\").where(\"os = 'Darwin'\").count()\nTo Transform the DataFrame object to an RDD, simply do:\nlongitudinal_rdd = longitudinal.rdd\nIn general, however, the DataFrames are performance optimized, so it's\nworth the effort to learn the DataFrame API.\nFor more overview, see the\nSQL Programming Guide.\nSee also the\nLongitudinal Tutorial,\none of the available example notebooks when you start a cluster.\nAvailable Data Sources for SparkSQL\nFor information about data sources available for querying (e.g. Longitudinal dataset),\nsee Choosing a Dataset.\nThese datasets are optimized for fast access, and will far out-perform\nanalysis on the raw Telemetry ping data.\nAccessing the Spark UI\nAfter establishing an SSH connection to the Spark cluster, go to https://localhost:8888/spark\nto see the Spark UI.\nIt has information about job statuses and task completion,\nand may help you debug your job.\nThe MozTelemetry Library\nWe have provided a library that gives easy access to the raw telemetry ping data.\nFor example usage, see the\nTelemetry Hello World\nexample notebook.\nDetailed documentation for the library can be found at the\nPython MozTelemetry Documentation.\nUsing the Raw Ping Data\nFirst off, import the moztelemetry library using the following:\nfrom moztelemetry.dataset import Dataset\nThe ping data is an RDD of JSON elements. For example, using the\nfollowing:\npings = Dataset.from_source(\"telemetry\") \\\n    .where(docType='main') \\\n    .where(submissionDate=\"20180101\") \\\n    .where(appUpdateChannel=\"nightly\") \\\n    .records(sc, sample=0.01)\n\nreturns an RDD of 1/100th of Firefox Nightly JSON pings submitted on\nfrom January 1 2018. Now, because it's JSON, pings are easy to access.\nFor example, to get the count of each OS type:\nos_names = pings.map(lambda x: (x['environment']['system']['os']['name'], 1))\nos_counts = os_names.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)\nos_counts.collect()\n\nAlternatively, moztelemetry provides the get_pings_properties\nfunction, which will gather the data for you:\nfrom moztelemetry import get_pings_properties\nsubset = get_pings_properties(pings, [\"environment/system/os/name\"])\nsubset.map(lambda x: (x[\"environment/system/os/name\"], 1)).reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collect()\n\nFAQ\nPlease add more FAQ as questions are answered by you or for you.\nHow can I load parquet datasets in a Jupyter notebook?\nUse spark.read.parquet, e.g.:\ndataset = spark.read.parquet(\"s3://the_bucket/the_prefix/the_version\")`\n\nFor more information see Working with Parquet.\nI got a REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! error\nAWS recycles hostnames, so this warning is expected.\nRemoving the offending key from $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts will remove the warning.\nYou can find the line to remove by finding the line in the output that says\nOffending key in /path/to/hosts/known_hosts:2\nWhere 2 is the line number of the key that can be deleted.\nJust remove that line, save the file, and try again.\nWhy is my notebook hanging?\nThere are a few common causes for this:\n\nCurrently, our Spark notebooks can only run a single Python kernel at\na time. If you open multiple notebooks on the same cluster and try to\nrun both, the second notebook will hang. Be sure to close notebooks\nusing \"Close and Halt\" under the \"File\" drop-down.\nThe connection from PySpark to the Spark driver might be lost.\nUnfortunately the best way to recover from this for the moment seems to\nbe spinning up a new cluster.\nCancelling execution of a notebook cell doesn't cancel any spark jobs\nthat might be running in the background. If your spark commands seem to\nbe hanging, try running `sc.cancelAllJobs()`.\n\nHow can I keep running after closing the notebook?\nFor long-running computation, it might be nice to close the notebook\n(and the SSH session) and look at the results later.\nUnfortunately, all cell output will be lost when a notebook is closed\n(for the running cell).\nTo alleviate this, there are a few options:\n\nHave everything output to a variable. These values should still be\navailable when you reconnect.\nPut %%capture at the beginning of the cell to store all output.\nSee the documentation.\n\nHow do I load an external library into the cluster?\nAssuming you've got a URL for the repo, you can create an egg for it\nthis way:\n!git clone `` && cd `` && python setup.py bdist_egg`\\\nsc.addPyFile('``/dist/my-egg-file.egg')`\n\nAlternately, you could just create that egg locally, upload it to a web\nserver, then download and install it:\nimport requests`\\\nr = requests.get('``')`\\\nwith open('mylibrary.egg', 'wb') as f:`\\\n  f.write(r.content)`\\\nsc.addPyFile('mylibrary.egg')`\n\nYou will want to do this before you load the library. If the library\nis already loaded, restart the kernel in the Jupyter notebook.\n"},"concepts/sql_style.html":{"url":"concepts/sql_style.html","title":"SQL Style Guide","keywords":"","body":"SQL Style

changes happening in Nightly could be the sign of an\nunintentional performance regression, so we introduced a system to\nautomatically detect and alert developers about such changes.\nThus we created Telemetry Alerts. It comes in two pieces:\nCerberus the Detector and\nMedusa the Front-end.\nCerberus\nEvery day Cerberus grabs the latest aggregated information about all\nnon-keyed Telemetry probes from aggregates.telemetry.mozilla.org and\ncompares the distribution of values from the Nightly builds of the\npast two days to the distribution of values from the Nightly builds of\nthe past seven days.\nIt does this by calculating the Bhattacharyya\ndistance between\nthe two distributions and guessing whether or not they are significant\nand\nnarrow.\nIt places all detected changes in a file for ingestion by Medusa.\nMedusa\nMedusa is in charge of emailing people when distributions change and for\ndisplaying the website https://alerts.telemetry.mozilla.org which\ncontains pertinent information about each detected regression.\nMedusa also checks for expiring histograms and sends emails notifying of\ntheir expiry.\nWhat it can do\nTelemetry Alerts is very good at identifying sudden changes in the\nshapes of normalized distributions of Telemetry probes. If you can see\nthe distribution of GC_MS shift from one day\nto the next, then likely so can Cerberus.\nWhat can't it do\nTelemetry Alerts is not able to see sudden shifts in volume. It is also\nvery easily fooled if a change happens over a long period of time or\ndoesn't fundamentally alter the shape of the probe's histogram.\nSo if you have a probe like\nSCALARS_BROWSER.ENGAGEMENT.MAX_CONCURRENT_TAB_COUNT,\nCerberus won't notice if:\n\nThe number of pings reporting this value decreased in half, but\notherwise reported the same spread of numbers\nThe value increases very slowly over time (which I'd expect it to do\ngiven how good Session Restore is these days)\nWe suddenly received twice as many pings from 200-tab subsessions\n(the dominance of 1-tab pings would likely ensure the overall shape\nof the distribution changed insufficiently much for Cerberus to pick\nup on it)\n\nTelemetry Alert Emails\nOne of the main ways humans interact with Telemetry Alerts is through\nthe emails sent by Medusa.\nAt present the email contains a link to the alert's page on\nhttps://alerts.telemetry.mozilla.org and a link to a pushlog on\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org detailing the changes newly-present in the\nNightly build that exhibited the change.\nTriaging a Telemetry Alert Email\nCongratulations! You have just received a Telemetry Alert!\nNow what?\nAssumption: Alerts happen because of changes in probes. Changes in\nprobes happen because of changes in related code. If we can identify the\ncode change, we can find the bug that introduced the code change. If we\ncan find the bug, we can ni? the person who made the change.\nGoal: Identify the human responsible for the Alert so they can\nidentify if it is\ngood/bad/intentional/exceptional/temporary/permanent/still\nrelevant/having its alerts properly looked after.\nGuide:\n1. Is this alert just one of a group of similar changes by topic? By\nbuild?\n\nIf there's a group by topic (SPDY, URLCLASSIFIER, ...) check to see\nif the changes are similar in direction/magnitude. They usually are.\nIf there's a group by build but not topic, maybe a large merge\nkicked things over. Unfortunate, as that will make finding the source\nmore difficult.\n\n2. Open the hg.mozilla.org and alerts.telemetry.mozilla.org links in\ntabs\n\nOn alerts.tmo, does it look like an improvement or regression? (This\nis just a first idea and might change. There are often extenuating\ncircumstances that make something that looks bad into an\nimprovement, and vice versa.)\nOn hg.mo, does the topic of the changed probe exist in the pushlog?\nIn other words, does any part of the probe's name show up in the\nsummaries of any of the commits?\n\n3. From alerts.tmo, open the https://telemetry.mozilla.org link by\nclicking on the plot's title. Open another tab to the Evolution View.\n\nIs the change temporary? (might have been noticed elsewhere and\nbacked out)\nIs the change up or down?\nHas it happened before?\nWas it accompanied by a decrease in submission volume? (the second\ngraph at the bottom of the Evolution View)\nOn the Distribution View, did the Sample Count increase? Decrease?\n(this signifies that the change could be because of the addition or\nsubtraction of a population of values. For instance, we could\nsuddenly stop sending 0 values which would shift the graph to\nthe right. This could be a good thing (we're not handling useless\nthings any longer) a bad thing (something broke and we're no longer\nmeasuring the same thing we used to measure) or indifferent)\n\n4. If you still don't have a cause\n\nUse DXR or searchfox to find where the probe is accumulated.\nClick \"Log\" in that view.\nAre there any changesets in the resultant hg.mo list that ended up\nin the build we received the Alert for?\n\n5. If you still don't know what's going on\n\nfind a domain expert on IRC and bother them to help you out. Domain\nknowledge is awesome.\n\nFrom pursuing these steps or sub-steps you should now have two things: a\nbug that likely caused the alert, and an idea of what the alert is\nabout.\nNow comment on the bug. Feel free to use this script:\nThis bug may have contributed to a sudden change in the Telemetry probe [1] which seems to have occurred in Nightly [2][3].\n\nThere was a .\nThis might mean \n\nIs this an improvement? A regression?\n\nIs this intentional? Is this expected?\n\nIs this probe still measuring something useful?\n\n[1]: \n[2]: \n[3]: \n\nThen ni? the person who pushed the change.

How in the world do you send a new ping? Follow this guide\nto find out.\nWrite Your Questions\nDo not try and implement new pings unless you know specifically what questions you're trying to\nanswer. General questions about \"How do users use our product?\" won't cut it - these need to be\nspecific, concrete asks that can be translated to data points. This will also make it easier down\nthe line as you start data review.\nMore detail on how to design and implement new pings for Firefox Desktop can be found here.\nChoose a Namespace and DocType\nFor new telemetry pings, the namespace is simply telemetry. For non-Telemetry\npings, choose a namespace that uniquely identifies the product that will be\ngenerating the data.\nThe DocType is used to differentiate pings within a namespace. It can be as\nsimple as event, but should generally be descriptive of the data being\ncollected.\nCreate a Schema\nUse JSON Schema to start with. See the \"Adding a new schema\" documentation and examples schemas in the\nMozilla Pipeline Schemas repo.\nThis schema is just used to validate the incoming data; any ping that doesn't match the schema\nwill be removed. Validate your JSON Schema using a\nvalidation tool.\nWe already have automatic deduplicating based on docId, which catches about 90% of duplicates and\nremoves them from the dataset.\nStart a Data Review\nData review for new pings is more complicated than when adding new probes. See\nData Review for Focus-Event Ping\nas an example. Consider where the data falls in the\nData Collection Categories.\nSubmit Schema to mozilla-services/mozilla-pipeline-schemas\nThe first schema added should be the JSON Schema made in step 2.\nAdd at least one example ping which the data can be validated against.\nThese test pings will be validated automatically during the build.\nAdditionally,\na Parquet output\nschema should be added. This would add a new dataset, available in Re:dash.\nThe best documentation we have for the Parquet schema is by looking at the examples in\nmozilla-pipeline-schemas.\nParquet output also has a metadata section. These are fields added to the ping at ingestion time;\nthey might come from the URL submitted to the edge server, or the IP Address used to make the request.\nThis document\nlists available metadata fields for all pings.\nThe stream you're interested in is probably telemetry.\nFor example, look at system-addon-deployment-diagnostics immediately under the telemetry top-level\nfield. The schema element has top-level fields (e.g. Timestamp, Type), as well as more fields\nunder the Fields element. Any of these can be used in the metadata section of your parquet schema,\nexcept for submission.\nSome common ones for Telemetry data might be:\n\nDate\nsubmissionDate\ngeoCountry\ngeoCity\ngeoSubdivision1\ngeoSubdivision2\nnormalizedChannel\nappVersion\nappBuildId\n\nAnd for non-Telemetry data:\n\ngeoCountry\ngeoCity\ngeoSubdivision1\ngeoSubdivision2\ndocumentId\n\nImportant Note: Schema evolution of nested structs is currently broken, so you will not be able to add\nany fields in the future to your metadata section. We recommend adding any that may seem useful.\nTesting The Schema\nFor new data, use the edge validator to test\nyour schema.\nIf your data is already being sent, and you want to test the schema you're writing on the data\nthat is currently being ingested, you can test your Parquet output in\nHindsight by using an output plugin.\nSee Core ping output plugin\nfor an example, where the parquet schema is specified as parquet_schema. If no errors arise, that\nmeans it should be correct. The \"Deploy\" button should not be used to actually deploy, that will be\ndone by operations in the next step.\n(Telemetry-specific) Deploy the Plugin\nFile a bug to deploy the new schema.\nReal-time analysis will be key to ensuring your data is being processed and parsed correctly.\nIt should follow the format specified in\nMozTelemetry docType monitor.\nThis allows you to check validation errors, size changes, duplicates, and more. Once you have\nthe numbers set, file a\nbug to let ops deploy it.\nStart Sending Data\nIf you're using the Telemetry APIs, use those built-in. These can be with the\nGecko Telemetry APIs,\nthe Android Telemetry APIs, or the\niOS Telemetry APIs.\nFor non-Telemetry data, see our HTTP edge server specification\nand specifically the non-Telemetry example for the expected format. The edge\nserver endpoint is https://incoming.telemetry.mozilla.org.\n(Non-Telemetry) Access Your Data\nFirst confirm with the reviewers of\nyour schema pull request\nthat your schemas have been deployed.\nIn the following links, replace ,  And  with\nappropriate values. Also replace - with _ in  if your\nnamespace contains - characters.\nCEP\nOnce you've sent some pings, refer to the following real-time analysis plugins\nto verify that your data is being processed:\n\nhttps://pipeline-cep.prod.mozaws.net/dashboard_output/graphs/analysis.moz_generic_error_monitor..html\nhttps://pipeline-cep.prod.mozaws.net/dashboard_output/analysis.moz_generic___.submissions.json\nhttps://pipeline-cep.prod.mozaws.net/dashboard_output/analysis.moz_generic___.errors.txt\n\nIf this first graph shows ingestion errors, you can view the corresponding\nerror messages in the third link. Otherwise, you should be able to view the\nlast ten processed submissions via the second link. You can also write your own\ncustom real-time analysis plugins using this same infrastructure if you desire;\nuse the above plugins as examples and see\nhere for a more detailed explanation.\nIf you encounter schema validation errors, you can fix your data or\nsubmit another pull request\nto amend your schemas. Backwards-incompatible schema changes should generally\nbe accompanied by an increment to docversion.\nOnce you've established that your pings are flowing through the real-time\nsystem, verify that you can access the data from the downstream systems.\nSTMO\nIn the Athena data source, a new table\n__parquet_ will be created for your data. A\nconvenience pointer __parquet will also refer to the latest\navailable docversion of the ping. The data is partitioned by\nsubmission_date_s3 which is formatted as %Y%m%d, like 20180130, and is\ngenerally updated hourly. Refer to the STMO documentation\nfor general information about using Re:dash.\nThis table may take up to a day to appear in the Athena source; if you still\ndon't see a table for your new ping after 24 hours,\ncontact Data Operations\nso that they can investigate. Once the table is available, it should contain\nall the pings sent during that first day, regardless of how long it takes for\nthe table to appear.\nATMO\nThe data should be available in S3 at:\ns3://net-mozaws-prod-us-west-2-pipeline-data/--parquet/v/\nNote: here  should not be escaped.\nRefer to the Spark FAQ for details on accessing this table via ATMO.\nWrite ETL Jobs\nWe have some basic generalized ETL jobs you can use to transform your data on a batch basis - for example,\na Longitudinal\nor client-count-daily\nlike dataset. Otherwise, you'll have to write your own.\nYou can schedule it on Airflow, or you can\nrun it as a job in ATMO. If the output is parquet, you can add it to the Hive metastore to have it\navailable in re:dash. Check the docs on creating your own datasets.\nBuild Dashboards Using ATMO or STMO\nLast steps!

If you're not sure which\ndataset to use for your query, this is probably what you want. It differs from\nthe main_summary table in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data for a client-id in the same row.\nThis makes it easy to report profile level metrics. Without this deduplicating,\nmetrics would be weighted by the number of submissions instead of by clients.\nThe dataset uses a 1% of all recent profiles, which will reduce query\ncomputation time and save resources. The sample of clients will be stable over\ntime.\n\nAccordingly, one should prefer using the Longitudinal dataset except in the\nrare case where a 100% sample is strictly necessary.\nAs discussed in the Longitudinal Data Set Example Notebook:\nThe longitudinal dataset is logically organized as a table where rows\nrepresent profiles and columns the various metrics (e.g. startup time). Each\nfield of the table contains a list of values, one per Telemetry submission\nreceived for that profile. [...]\n\nThe current version of the longitudinal dataset has been build with all\nmain pings received from 1% of profiles across all channels with [...] up to\n180 days of data.\nTable structure\nTo get an overview of the longitudinal data table:\nDESCRIBE longitudinal\n\nThat table has a row for each client, with columns for the different\nparts of the ping. There are a lot of fields here, so I recommend\ndownloading the results as a CSV if you want to search through these\nfields. Unfortunately, there's no way to filter the output of DESCRIBE\nin Presto.\nBecause this table combines all rows for a given client id, most columns\ncontain either Arrays or Maps (described below). A few properties are\ndirectly available to query on:\nSELECT count(*) AS count\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nArrays\nMost properties are arrays, which contain one entry for each submission\nfrom a given client (newest first). Note that indexing starts at 1:\nSELECT reason[1] AS newest_reason\nFROM longitudinal\nWHERE os = 'Linux'\n\nTo expand arrays and maps and work on the data row-wise we can use\nUNNEST(array).\nWITH lengths AS\n  (SELECT os, greatest(-1, least(31, sl / (24*60*60))) AS days\n   FROM longitudinal\n   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(session_length, reason) AS t(sl, r)\n   WHERE r = 'shutdown' OR r = 'aborted-session')\nSELECT os, days, count(*) AS count\nFROM lengths\nGROUP BY days, os ORDER BY days ASC\n\nHowever, it may be better to use a sample from the main_summary table\ninstead.\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on array\nfunctions\nUNNEST\ndocumentation\n\nMaps\nSome fields like active_addons or user_prefs are handled as maps, on\nwhich you can use the [] operator and special functions:\nWITH adp AS\n  (SELECT active_addons[1]['{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}']\n            IS NOT null AS has_adblockplus\n   FROM longitudinal)\nSELECT has_adblockplus, count(*) AS count\nFROM adp GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC\n\nLinks:\n\nDocumentation on map\nfunctions\n\nSampling\nWhile composing queries, it can be helpful to work on small samples to\nreduce query runtime:\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal LIMIT 1000 ...\n\nThere's no need to use other sampling methods, such as TABLESAMPLE, on\nthe longitudinal set. Rows are randomly ordered, so a LIMIT sample is\nexpected to be random.\nExample Queries\nBlocklist URLs (extensions.blocklist.url)\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).user_prefs['extensions.blocklist.url'] AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nBlocklist enabled/disabled (extensions.blocklist.enabled) count:\nSELECT bl, COUNT(bl)\nFROM\n  (SELECT element_at(settings, 1).blocklist_enabled AS bl\n   FROM longitudinal)\nGROUP BY bl\n\nParsing most recent submission_date\nSELECT DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z') as parsed_submission_date\nFROM longitudinal\n\nLimiting to most recent ping in the last 7 days\nSELECT * FROM longitudinal\nWHERE DATE_DIFF('day', DATE_PARSE(submission_date[1], '%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00.000Z'), current_date) \nScalar measurement (how many users with more than 100 tabs)\nWITH samples AS\n (SELECT\n   client_id,\n   normalized_channel as channel,\n   mctc.value AS max_concurrent_tabs\n  FROM longitudinal\n  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count) as t (mctc)\n  WHERE\n   scalar_parent_browser_engagement_max_concurrent_tab_count is not null and\n   mctc.value is not null and\n   normalized_channel = 'nightly')\nSELECT approx_distinct(client_id) FROM samples WHERE max_concurrent_tabs > 100\n\nKeyed scalars\nRetrieve all the keys for a given scalar and sum all values for each key giving\none row per key:\nSELECT t.key as open_type,\n       SUM(REDUCE(t.val, 0, (s, x) -> s + COALESCE(x.value, 0), s -> s)) as open_count,\n       normalized_channel AS \"channel::multi-filter\"\nFROM longitudinal\nCROSS JOIN UNNEST(scalar_parent_devtools_responsive_open_trigger) AS t(key, val)\nGROUP BY t.key, normalized_channel\n\nThis query also makes use of multi-filter to show an interactive filter in\nRe:dash.\nThis query requires a modern version of Presto, and because of this it currently\nwith the Presto data source but it doesn't work with the Athena data source.\nUsing Views\nIf you find yourself copy/pasting SQL between different queries,\nconsider using a Presto VIEW to allow for code reuse. Views create\nlogical tables which you can reuse in other queries. For example, this\nview defines some\nimportant filters and derived variables which are then used in this\ndownstream\nquery.\nYou can define a view by prefixing your query with\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS ...\n\nBe careful not to overwrite an existing view! Using a unique name is\nimportant.\nFind more information\nhere.\nWorking offline\nIt's often useful to keep a local sample of the longitudinal data when\nprototyping an analysis.

Please direct questions/concerns to Ben Miroglio (bmiroglio).\nRetention\nRetention measures the rate at which users are continuing to use Firefox, making it one of the more important metrics we track. We commonly measure retention between releases, experiment cohorts, and various Firefox subpopulations to better understand how a change to the user experience or use of a specific feature affect behavior.\nN Week Retention\nTime is an embedded component of retention. Most retention analysis starts with some anchor, or action that is associated with a date (experiment enrollment date, profile creation date, button clicked on date d, etc.). We then look 1, 2, …, N weeks beyond the anchor to see what percent of users have submitted a ping (signaling their continued use of Firefox).\nFor example, let’s say we are calculating retention for new Firefox users. Each user can then be anchored by their profile_creation_date, and we can count the number of users who submitted a ping between 7-13 days after profile creation (1 Week retention), 14-20 days after profile creation (2 Week Retention), etc.\nExample Methodology\nGiven a dataset in Spark, we can construct a field retention_period that uses submission_date_s3 to determine the period to which a ping belongs (i.e. if a user created their profile on April 1st, all pings submitted between April 8th and April 14th are assigned to week 1). 1-week retention can then be simplified to the percent of users with a 1 value for retention_period, 2-week retention simplifies to the percent of users with a 2 value for retention_period, ..., etc. Note that each retention period is independent of the others, so it is possible to have higher 2-week retention than 1-week retention (especially during holidays). \nFirst let's map 1, 2, ..., N week retention the the amount of days elapsed after the anchor point:\nPERIODS = {}\nN_WEEKS = 6\nfor i in range(1, N_WEEKS + 1):\n    PERIODS[i] = {\n        'start': i * 7,\n        'end': i * 7 + 6\n    }\n\nWhich gives us\n{1: {'end': 13, 'start': 7},\n 2: {'end': 20, 'start': 14},\n 3: {'end': 27, 'start': 21},\n 4: {'end': 34, 'start': 28},\n 5: {'end': 41, 'start': 35},\n 6: {'end': 48, 'start': 42}}\n\nNext, let's define some helper functions: \nimport datetime as dt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pyspark.sql.types as st\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\nudf = F.udf\n\ndef date_diff(d1, d2, fmt='%Y%m%d'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns days elapsed from d2 to d1 as an integer\n\n    Params:\n    d1 (str)\n    d2 (str)\n    fmt (str): format of d1 and d2 (must be the same)\n\n    >>> date_diff('20170205', '20170201')\n    4\n\n    >>> date_diff('20170201', '20170205)\n    -4\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return (pd.to_datetime(d1, format=fmt) - \n                pd.to_datetime(d2, format=fmt)).days\n    except:\n        return None\n\n\n@udf(returnType=st.IntegerType())\ndef get_period(anchor, submission_date_s3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an anchor and a submission_date_s3,\n    returns what period a ping belongs to.

The example code snippets are consolidated in this notebook.\nNew vs. Existing User Retention\nThe above example calculates New User Retention, which is distinct from Existing User Retention. This distinction is important when understanding retention baselines (i.e. does this number make sense?). Existing users typically have much higher retention numbers than new users. \nNote that is more common in industry to refer to Existing User Retention as \"Churn\" (Churn = 1 - Retention), however, we use retention across the board for the sake of consistency and interpretability.\nPlease be sure to specify whether or not your retention analysis is for new or existing users.\nWhat If There's No Anchor Point?\nSometimes there isn't a clear anchor point like profile_creation_date or enrollment_date. \nFor example, imagine you are tasked with reporting retention numbers for users that enabled sync (sync_configured) compared to users that haven't. Being a boolean pref, there is no straightforward way to determine when sync_enabled flipped from false to true aside from looking at a client's entire history (which is not recommended!). What now?\nWe can construct an artificial anchor point using fixed weekly periods; the retention concepts then remain unchanged. The process can be summarized by the following steps:\n\nDefine a baseline week cohort\nFor this example let's define the baseline as users that submitted pings between 2018-01-01 and 2018-01-07\n\n\nCount all users with/without sync enabled in this period\nAssign these users to an anchor point of 2018-01-01 (the beginning of the baseline week)\nCount the number of users in the baseline week that submitted a ping between 7-13 days after 2018-01-01 (1 Week retention), 14-20 days after 2018-01-01 (2 Week Retention), etc.\nShift the baseline week up 7 days (and all other dates) and repeat as necessary\n\nThis method is also valid in the presence of an anchor point, however, it is recommended the anchor point method is employed when possible.\nConfounding Factors\nWhen performing retention analysis between two or more groups, it is important to look at other usage metrics to get an understanding of other influential factors.\nFor example (borrowing the sync example from the previous section) you find that users with and without sync have a 1 week retention of 0.80 and 0.40, respectively. Wow--we should really be be promoting sync as it could double retention numbers!\nNot quite. Turns out you next look at active_ticks and total_uri_count and find that sync users report much higher numbers for these measures as well. Now how can we explain this difference in retention?\nThere could be an entirely separate cookbook devoted to answering this question, however this contrived example is meant to demonstrate that simply comparing retention numbers between two groups isn't capturing the full story. Sans an experiment or model-based approach, all we can say is \"enabling sync is associated with higher retention numbers.\" There is still value in this assertion, however it should be stressed that association/correlation != causation!\n"},"experiments/shield_intro.html":{"url":"experiments/shield_intro.html","title":"Experimenting and Evidence (Shield Program)","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started With Shield\n\"Shield\" Means Different Things in Different Contexts\n\"Shield\" conflates several overlapping concepts.\n\nFeature Experimentation using Shield\nOff-Train Deployment of code, messages, configuration using Delivery Console\nShield Study Addons (webExtensionExperiments)\nshield-studies and shield-studies-addons Telemetry Pings / Data Set\n\nWe think of Shield as the culmination of the Go Faster program.\nFacts you should know about Shield\n\nShield is Mozilla's program for gathering evidence to make better decisions.  \n All policies, processes, and engineering choices serve that goal.\n\nTell us you exist, so we can help your project.  \n If we don't know about your project, we can't offer any help.

Queries\nScheduling\nSchema\nCode Reference\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe churn dataset tracks the 7-day churn rate of telemetry profiles. This\ndataset is generally used for analyzing cohort churn across segments and time.\nContent\nChurn is the rate of attrition defined by (clients seen in week N)/(clients seen in week 0)\nfor groups of clients with some shared attributes. A group of clients with\nshared attributes is called a cohort. The cohorts in this dataset are created\nevery week and can be tracked over time using the acquisition_date and the\nweeks since acquisition or current_week.\nThe following example demonstrates the current logic for generating this\ndataset. Each column represents the days since some arbitrary starting date.\n\n\n\nclient\n00\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nAll three clients are part of the same cohort. Client A is retained for weeks 0\nand 1 since there is activity in both periods. A client only needs to show up\nonce in the period to be counted as retained. Client B is acquired in week 0 and\nis active frequently but does not appear in following weeks. Client B is\nconsidered churned on week 1. However, a client that is churned can become\nretained again. Client C is considered churned on week 1 but retained on week 3.\nThe following table summarizes the above daily activity into the following view\nwhere every column represents the current week since acquisition date..\n\n\n\nclient\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nA\nX\nX\n\n\n\nB\nX\n\n\n\n\nC\nX\n\nX\n\n\n\nThe clients are then grouped into cohorts by attributes. An attribute describes\na property about the cohort such as the country of origin or the binary\ndistribution channel. Each group also contains descriptive aggregates of\nengagement. Each metric describes the activity of a cohort such as size and\noverall usage at a given time instance.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nEach row in this dataset describes a unique segment of users\nThe number of rows is exponential with the number of dimensions\nNew fields should be added sparing to account for data-set size\n\n\nThe dataset lags by 10 days in order account for submission latency\nThis value was determined to be time for 99% of main pings to arrive at the\nserver. With the shutdown-ping sender, this has been reduced to 4 days.\nHowever, churn_v3 still tracks releases older than Firefox 55.\n\n\nThe start of the period is fixed to Sundays. Once it has been aggregated, the\nperiod cannot be shifted due to the way clients are counted.\nA supplementary 1-day retention dataset using HyperLogLog for client\ncounts is available for counting over arbitrary retention periods and date\noffsets. Additionally, calculating churn or retention over specific cohorts\nis tractable in STMO with main_summary or clients_daily datasets.\n\n\n\nAccessing the Data\nchurn is available in Re:dash under Athena and Presto.

invalid pings in our processing. Invalid pings are defined as those that:\n\nThe submission dates or activity dates are invalid or missing.\nThe build ID is malformed.\nThe docType field is missing or unknown.\nThe ping is a main ping without usage hours or a crash ping with usage hours.\n\nScheduling\nThe crash_aggregates job is run daily, at midnight UTC.\nThe job is scheduled on Airflow.\nThe DAG is here\nSchema\nThe crash_aggregates table has 4 commonly-used columns:\n\nsubmission_date is the date pings were submitted for a particular aggregate.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where submission_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by pings submitted on March 15, 2016.\nThe dataset is partitioned by this field. Queries that limit the possible values of submission_date can run significantly faster.\n\n\nactivity_date is the day when the activity being recorded took place.\nFor example, select sum(stats['usage_hours']) from crash_aggregates where activity_date = '2016-03-15' will give the total number of user hours represented by activities that took place on March 15, 2016.\nThis can be several days before the pings are actually submitted, so it will always be before or on its corresponding submission_date.\nTherefore, queries that are sensitive to when measurements were taken on the client should prefer this field over submission_date.\n\n\ndimensions is a map of all the other dimensions that we currently care about. These fields include:\ndimensions['build_version'] is the program version, like 46.0a1.\ndimensions['build_id'] is the YYYYMMDDhhmmss timestamp the program was built, like 20160123180541. This is also known as the build ID or buildid.\ndimensions['channel'] is the channel, like release or beta.\ndimensions['application'] is the program name, like Firefox or Fennec.\ndimensions['os_name'] is the name of the OS the program is running on, like Darwin or Windows_NT.\ndimensions['os_version'] is the version of the OS the program is running on.\ndimensions['architecture'] is the architecture that the program was built for (not necessarily the one it is running on).\ndimensions['country'] is the country code for the user (determined using geoIP), like US or UK.\ndimensions['experiment_id'] is the identifier of the experiment being participated in, such as e10s-beta46-noapz@experiments.mozilla.org, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['experiment_branch'] is the branch of the experiment being participated in, such as control or experiment, or null if no experiment.\ndimensions['e10s_enabled'] is whether E10s is enabled.\ndimensions['gfx_compositor'] is the graphics backend compositor used by the program, such as d3d11, opengl and simple. Null values may be reported as none as well.\nAll of the above fields can potentially be blank, which means \"not present\". That means that in the actual pings, the corresponding fields were null.\n\n\nstats contains the aggregate values that we care about:\nstats['usage_hours'] is the number of user-hours represented by the aggregate.\nstats['main_crashes'] is the number of main process crashes represented by the aggregate (or just program crashes, in the non-E10S case).\nstats['content_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['plugin_crashes'] is the number of plugin process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['gmplugin_crashes'] is the number of Gecko media plugin (often abbreviated GMPlugin) process crashes represented by the aggregate.\nstats['content_shutdown_crashes'] is the number of content process crashes that were caused by failure to shut down in a timely manner.\nstats['gpu_crashes'] is the number of GPU process crashes represented by the aggregate.\n\n\n\nTODO(harter): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361862\n"},"datasets/batch_view/crash_summary/reference.html":{"url":"datasets/batch_view/crash_summary/reference.html","title":"Crash Summary","keywords":"","body":"Crash Summary Reference\n\n\nIntroduction\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nSampling\nScheduling\nSchema\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe crash_summary table is the most direct representation of a crash ping.\nContents\nThe crash_summary table contains one row for each crash ping.\nEach column represents one field from the crash ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all crash ping fields are included.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/crash_summary/v1/\ncrash_summary is accessible through re:dash.\nHere's an example query.\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for crash_summary is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is\nhere\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nHere is an example query to get the total number of main crashes by gfx_compositor:\nselect gfx_compositor, count(*)\nfrom crash_summary\nwhere application = 'Firefox'\nand (payload.processType IS NULL OR payload.processType = 'main')\ngroup by gfx_compositor\n\nSampling\nCrashSummary contains one record for every\ncrash ping\nsubmitted by Firefox.\nIt was built with the long term goal of providing a base for\nCrashAggregates.\nScheduling\nThis dataset is updated daily, shortly after midnight UTC.\nThe job is scheduled on\ntelemetry-airflow.\nThe DAG is here.\nSchema\nroot\n |-- client_id: string (nullable = true)\n |-- normalized_channel: string (nullable = true)\n |-- build_version: string (nullable = true)\n |-- build_id: string (nullable = true)\n |-- channel: string (nullable = true)\n |-- application: string (nullable = true)\n |-- os_name: string (nullable = true)\n |-- os_version: string (nullable = true)\n |-- architecture: string (nullable = true)\n |-- country: string (nullable = true)\n |-- experiment_id: string (nullable = true)\n |-- experiment_branch: string (nullable = true)\n |-- experiments: map (nullable = true)\n |    |-- key: string\n |    |-- value: string (valueContainsNull = true)\n |-- e10s_enabled: boolean (nullable = true)\n |-- gfx_compositor: string (nullable = true)\n |-- profile_created: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- payload: struct (nullable = true)\n |    |-- crashDate: string (nullable = true)\n |    |-- processType: string (nullable = true)\n |    |-- hasCrashEnvironment: boolean (nullable = true)\n |    |-- metadata: map (nullable = true)\n |    |    |-- key: string\n |    |    |-- value: string (valueContainsNull = true)\n |    |-- version: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- submission_date: string (nullable = true)\nFor more detail on where these fields come from in the\nraw data,\nplease look at the case classes\nin the CrashSummaryView code.\n"},"datasets/batch_view/cross_sectional/reference.html":{"url":"datasets/batch_view/cross_sectional/reference.html","title":"Cross Sectional","keywords":"","body":"Cross Sectional Reference\nThis data set has been deprecated in favor of Clients Daily\n"},"datasets/streaming/error_aggregates/reference.html":{"url":"datasets/streaming/error_aggregates/reference.html","title":"Error Aggregates","keywords":"","body":"Error Aggregates Reference\n\n\nIntroduction\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nSampling\nData sources\n\n\nScheduling\nSchema\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe error_aggregates table represents counts of errors counted from main and crash\npings, aggregated every 5 minutes.

sample is consistent over time.\nThe longitudinal dataset is regenerated weekly.\nThe clients included in each run are very similar with this process.\nThe only change will come from never-before-seen clients,\nor clients without a ping in the last 180 days.\nWe don't need to adjust the sample as new clients enter or exit our pool.\n\nMore practically,\nthe sample is created by filtering to pings with main_summary.sample_id == 42.\nIf you're working with main_summary,\nyou can recreate this sample by doing this filter manually.\nScheduling\nThe longitudinal job is run weekly, early on Sunday morning UTC.\nThe job is scheduled on Airflow.\nThe DAG is here.\nSchema\nTODO(harter): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361862\nCode Reference\nThis dataset is generated

Reference\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe main_summary table is the most direct representation of a main ping\nbut can be difficult to work with due to its size. \nPrefer the longitudinal dataset unless using the sampled data is prohibitive.\nContents\nThe main_summary table contains one row for each ping.\nEach column represents one field from the main ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all main ping fields are included.\nThis dataset does not include histograms.\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is massive, and due to its size, it can be difficult to work with.\nYou should avoid querying main_summary from re:dash.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash on a shared cluster.\nInstead, we recommend using the longitudinal or clients_daily dataset where possible.\nIf these datasets do not suffice, consider using Spark on an\nATMO cluster.\nIn the odd case where these queries are necessary,\nmake use of the sample_id field and limit to a short submission date range.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/main_summary/v4/\nThough not recommended main_summary is accessible through re:dash. \nHere's an example query.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash is on a shared cluster.\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for main_summary is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is \nhere\nAdding New Fields\nWe support a few basic types that can be easily added to main_summary.\nNon-addon scalars are automatically added to main_summary.\nUser Preferences\nThese are added in the userPrefsList, near the top of the\nMain Summary file.\nThey must be available in the ping environment\nto be included here. There is more information in the file itself.\nOnce added, they will show as top-level fields, with the string user_pref prepended. For example, IntegerUserPref(\"dom.ipc.processCount\") becomes user_pref_dom_ipc_processcount.\nHistograms\nHistograms can simply be added to the histogramsWhitelist near the top of\nMain Summary file.\nSimply add the name of the histogram in the alphabetically-sorted position in the list.\nEach process a histogram is recorded in will have a column in main_summary, with the string histogram_ prepended. For example, CYCLE_COLLECTOR_MAX_PAUSE\nis recorded in the parent, content, and gpu processes (according to the definition).\nIt will then result in three columns:\n\nhistogram_parent_cycle_collector_max_pause\nhistogram_content_cycle_collector_max_pause\nhistogram_gpu_cycle_collector_max_pause\n\nAddon Scalars\nAddon scalars are recorded by an addon. To include one of these, add the definition to the\naddon scalars definition file in telemetry-batch-view.\nBe sure to include the section:\n    record_in_processes:\n      - 'dynamic'\nThe addon scalars can then be found in the associated column, depending on their type:\n\nstring_addon_scalars\nkeyed_string_addon_scalars\nuint_addon_scalars\nkeyed_uint_addon_scalars\nboolean_addon_scalars\nkeyed_boolean_addon_scalars\n\nThese columns are all maps. Each addon scalar will be a key within that map, concatenating the top-level subsection within Scalars.yaml with its name to get the key. As an example, consider the following scalar definition:\ntest:\n  misunderestimated_nucular:\n    description: A test scalar, no soup for you!\n    expires: never\n    kind: string\n    keyed: true\n    notification_emails:\n      - frank@mozilla.com\n    record_in_processes:\n      - 'dynamic'\nFor example, you could find the addon scalar test.misunderestimated_nucular, a keyed string scalar, using keyed_string_addon_scalars['test_misunderestimated_nucular'].\nIn general, use element_at, which returns NULL when the key is not found: element_at(keyed_string_addon_scalars, 'test_misunderestimated_nucular')\nOther Fields\nWe can include other types of fields as well, for example if there needs to be a specific transformation done. We do need the data to be available in the Main Ping\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nWe recommend working with this dataset via Spark rather than sql.t.m.o.\nDue to the large number of records,\nqueries can consume a lot of resources on the\nshared cluster and impact other users.\nQueries via sql.t.m.o should limit to a short submission_date_s3 range,\nand ideally make use of the sample_id field.\nWhen using Presto to query the data from sql.t.m.o,\nyou can use the UNNEST feature to access items in the\nsearch_counts, popup_notification_stats and active_addons fields.\nFor example, to compare the search volume for different search source values,\nyou could use:\nWITH search_data AS (\n  SELECT\n    s.source AS search_source,\n    s.count AS search_count\n  FROM\n    main_summary\n    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(search_counts) AS t(s)\n  WHERE\n    submission_date_s3 = '20160510'\n    AND sample_id = '42'\n    AND search_counts IS NOT NULL\n)\n\nSELECT\n  search_source,\n  sum(search_count) as total_searches\nFROM search_data\nGROUP BY search_source\nORDER BY sum(search_count) DESC\n\nSampling\nThe main_summary dataset contains one record for each main ping\nas long as the record contains a non-null value for\ndocumentId, submissionDate, and Timestamp.\nWe do not ever expect nulls for these fields.\nScheduling\nThis dataset is updated daily via the telemetry-airflow infrastructure.\nThe job DAG runs every day shortly after midnight UTC.\nYou can find the job definition\nhere\nSchema\nAs of 2017-12-03, the current version of the main_summary dataset is v4, and has

these fields come from in the\nraw data,\nplease look\nin the MainSummaryView code.\nin the buildSchema function.\nMost of the fields are simple scalar values, with a few notable exceptions:\n\nThe search_count field is an array of structs, each item in the array representing\na 3-tuple of (engine, source, count). The engine field represents the name of\nthe search engine against which the searches were done. The source field represents\nthe part of the Firefox UI that was used to perform the search. It contains values\nsuch as abouthome, urlbar, and searchbar. The count field contains the number\nof searches performed against this engine+source combination during that subsession.\nAny of the fields in the struct may be null (for example if the search key did not\nmatch the expected pattern, or if the count was non-numeric).\nThe loop_activity_counter field is a simple struct containing inner fields for each\nexpected value of the LOOP_ACTIVITY_COUNTER Enumerated Histogram. Each inner field\nis a count for that histogram bucket.\nThe popup_notification_stats field is a map of String keys to struct values,\neach field in the struct being a count for the expected values of the\nPOPUP_NOTIFICATION_STATS Keyed Enumerated Histogram.\nThe places_bookmarks_count and places_pages_count fields contain the mean\nvalue of the corresponding Histogram, which can be interpreted as the average number\nof bookmarks or pages in a given subsession.\nThe active_addons field contains an array of structs, one for each entry in\nthe environment.addons.activeAddons section of the payload. More detail in\nBug 1290181.\nThe disabled_addons_ids field contains an array of strings, one for each entry in\nthe payload.addonDetails which is not already reported in the environment.addons.activeAddons\nsection of the payload. More detail in\nBug 1390814.\nPlease note that while using this field is generally OK, this was introduced to support\nthe TAAR project and you should not count on it\nin the future.

The project is tracked in Bug 1381840\nContents\nThe retention table contains a set of attribute columns used to specify a\ncohort of users and a set of metric columns to describe cohort activity. Each\nrow contains a permutation of attributes, an approximate set of clients in a\ncohort, and the aggregate engagement metrics.\nThis table uses the HyperLogLog (HLL) sketch to create an approximate set of\nclients in a cohort. HLL allows counting across overlapping cohorts in a single\npass while avoiding the problem of double counting. This data-structure has the\nbenefit of being compact and performant in the context of retention analysis,\nat the expense of precision. For example, calculating a 7-day retention period\ncan be obtained by aggregating over a week of retention data using the union\noperation. With SQL primitive, this requires a recalculation of COUNT DISTINCT\nover client_id's in the 7-day window.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nThe data starts at 2017-03-06, the merge date where Nightly started to\ntrack Firefox 55 in Mozilla-Central. However, there was\nnot a consistent view into the behavior of first session profiles until the\nnew_profile ping. This means much of the data is inaccurate\nbefore 2017-06-26.\nThis dataset uses 4 day reporting latency to aggregate at least 99% of the\ndata in a given submission date. This figure is derived from the\ntelemetry-health measurements on submission latency, with\nthe discussion in Bug 1407410. This latency metric was reduced\nFirefox 55 with the introduction of the shutdown ping-sender mechanism.\nCaution should be taken before adding new columns. Additional attribute\ncolumns will grow the number of rows exponentially.\nThe number of HLL bits chosen for this dataset is 13. This means the default\nsize of the HLL object is 2^13 bits or 1KiB. This maintains about a 1% error\non average. See this table from Algebird's HLL implementation for\nmore details.\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is primarily available through Re:dash on STMO via\nthe Presto source. This service has been configured to use predefined HLL\nfunctions.\nThe column should first be cast to the HLL type. The scalar\ncardinality() function will approximate the number of unique\nitems per HLL object. The aggregate merge() function will perform\nthe set union between all objects in a column.\nExample: Cast the count column into the appropriate type.\nSELECT cast(hll as HLL) as n_profiles_hll FROM retention\n\nCount the number of clients seen over all attribute combinations.\nSELECT cardinality(cast(hll as HLL)) FROM retention\n\nGroup-by and aggregate client counts over different release channels.\nSELECT channel, cardinality(merge(cast(hll AS HLL))\nFROM retention\nGROUP BY channel\n\nThe HyperLogLog library wrappers are available for use outside of the\nconfigured STMO environment, spark-hyperloglog and\npresto-hyperloglog.\nAlso see the client_count_daily dataset.\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nSee the Example Usage Dashboard for more usages of datasets of\nthe same shape.\nScheduling\nThe job is scheduled on Airflow on a daily basis after main_summary is run\nfor the day.

This dataset is used to produce graphs like\nLet's Encrypt's to determine SSL adoption on the Web\nover time.\nContent\nThe public SSL dataset is a table where each row is a distinct set of dimensions, with their\nassociated SSL statistics. The dimensions are submission_date, os, and country. The\nstatistics are reporting_ratio, normalized_pageloads, and ratio.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nWe're using normalized values in normalized_pageloads to obscure absolute page load counts.\nThis is across the entirety of release, not per-version, because we're looking at Web health,\nnot Firefox user health.\nAny dimension tuple (any given combination of submission_date, os, and country) with \nfewer than 5000 page loads is omitted from the dataset.\nThis is hopefully just a temporary dataset to stopgap release aggregates going away\nuntil we can come up with a better way to publicly publish datasets.\n\nAccessing the Data\nFor details on accessing the data, please look at\nbug 1414839.\nData Reference\nCombining Rows\nThis is a dataset of ratios. You can't combine ratios if they have different bases. For example,\nif 50% of 10 loads (5 loads) were SSL and 5% of 20 loads (1 load) were SSL, you cannot calculate\nthat 20% (6 loads) of the total loads (30 loads) were SSL unless you know that the 50% was for\n10 and the 5% was for 20.\nIf you're reluctant, for product reasons, to share the numbers 10 and 20, this gets tricky.\nSo what we've done is normalize the whole batch of 30 down to 1. That means we tell you that\n50% of one-third of the loads (0.333...) was SSL and 5% of the other two-thirds of the loads\n(0.666...) was SSL. Then you can figure out the overall 20% figure by this calculation:\n0.5 * 0.333 + 0.05 * 0.666 = 0.2\nFor this dataset the same rule applies. To combine rows' ratios (to, for example, see what the\nSSL ratio was across all os and country for a given submission_date), you must first\nmultiply them by the rows' normalized_pageviews values.\nOr, in JavaScript:\nlet rows = query_result.data.rows;\nlet ratioForDateInQuestion = rows\n  .filter(row => row.submission_date == dateInQuestion)\n  .reduce((row, acc) => acc + row.normalized_pageloads * row.ratio, 0);\n\nSchema\nThe data is output in re:dash API format:\n\"query_result\": {\n  \"retrieved_at\": ,\n  \"query_hash\": ,\n  \"query\": ,\n  \"runtime\": ,\n  \"id\": ,\n  \"data_source_id\": 26, // Athena\n  \"data_scanned\": ,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"data_scanned\": ,\n    \"columns\": [\n      {\"friendly_name\": \"submission_date\", \"type\": \"datetime\", \"name\": \"submission_date\"},\n      {\"friendly_name\": \"os\", \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"os\"},\n      {\"friendly_name\": \"country\", \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"country\"},\n      {\"friendly_name\": \"reporting_ratio\", \"type\": \"float\", \"name\": \"reporting_ratio\"},\n      {\"friendly_name\": \"normalized_pageloads\", \"type\": \"float\", \"name\": \"normalized_pageloads\"},\n      {\"friendly_name\": \"ratio\", \"type\": \"float\", \"name\": \"ratio\"}\n    ],\n    \"rows\": [\n      {\n        \"submission_date\": \"2017-10-24T00:00:00\", // date string, day resolution\n        \"os\": \"Windows_NT\", // operating system family of the clients reporting the pageloads.

group for search on Github and Bugzilla.\nIf you reach a 404 on Github or don't have access to a re:dash query or bug\nthis is likely your issue.\nTo get access permissions, file a bug using the search permissions template\nOnce you have proper permissions,\nyou'll have access to a new source in re:dash called Presto Search.\nYou will not be able to access any of the search datasets\nvia the standard Presto data source, even with proper permissions.\nTerminology\nDirect vs Follow-on Search\nSearches can be split into two major classes: direct and follow-on.\nDirect searches result from a direct interaction with a search access point (SAP),\nwhich is part of the Firefox UI.\nThese searches are often called SAP searches.\nThere are currently 6 SAPs:\n\nurlbar - entering a search query in the Awesomebar\nsearchbar - the main search bar; not present by default for new profiles on Firefox 57+\nnewtab - the search bar on the about:newtab page\nabouthome - the search bar on the about:home page\ncontextmenu - selecting text and clicking \"Search\" from the context menu\nsystem - starting Firefox from the command line with an option that immediately makes a search\n\nUsers will often interact with the Search Engine Results Page (SERP)\nto create \"downstream\" queries.\nThese queries are called follow-on queries.\nThese are sometimes also referred to as in-content queries\nsince they are initiated from the content of the page itself\nand not from the Firefox UI.\nFor example, follow-on queries can be caused by:\n\nRevising a query (restaurants becomes restaurants near me)\nClicking on the \"next\" button\nAccepting spelling suggestions\n\nTagged vs Untagged Searches\nOur partners (search engines) attribute queries to Mozilla using partner codes.\nWhen a user issues a query through one of our SAPs,\nwe include our partner code in the URL of the resulting search.\nTagged queries are queries that include one of our partner codes.\nUntagged queries are queries that do not include one of our partner codes.\nIf a query is untagged,\nit's usually because we do not have a partner deal for that search engine and region.\nIf an SAP query is tagged, any follow-on query should also be tagged.\nStandard Search Aggregates\nWe report three types of searches in our search datasets:\nSAP, tagged-sap, and tagged-follow-on.\nThese aggregates show up as columns in the\nsearch_aggregates and search_clients_daily datasets.\nOur search datasets are all derived from main_summary.\nThe aggregate columns are derived from the SEARCH_COUNTS histogram.\nThe SAP column counts all SAP (or direct) searches.\nSAP search counts are collected via\nprobes\nwithin the Firefox UI\nThese counts are very reliable, but do not count follow-on queries.\nIn 2017-06 we deployed the [followonsearch addon],\nwhich adds probes for tagged-sap and tagged-follow-on searches.\nThese columns attempt to count all tagged searches\nby looking for Mozilla partner codes in the URL of requests to partner search engines.\nThese search counts are critical to understanding revenue\nsince they exclude untagged searches and include follow-on searches.\nHowever, these search counts have important caveats affecting their reliability.\nSee In Content Telemetry Issues for more information.\nIn main_summary, all of these searches are stored in search_counts.count,\nwhich makes it easy to over count searches.\nAvoid using main_summary for search analyses.\nOutlier Filtering\nWe remove search count observations representing more than\n10,000 searches for a single search engine in a single ping.\nIn Content Telemetry Issues\nThe [followonsearch addon] implements the probe\nused to measure tagged-sap and tagged-follow-on searches.\nThis probe is critical to understanding our revenue.\nIt's the only tool that gives us a view of follow-on searches\nand differentiates between tagged and untagged queries.\nHowever, it comes with some notable caveats.\nRelies on whitelists\nThe [followonsearch addon] attempts to count all tagged searches\nby looking for Mozilla partner codes in the URL of requests to partner search engines.\nTo do this, the addon relies on a whitelist of partner codes and URL formats.\nThe list of partner codes is incomplete and only covers a few top partners.\nThese codes also occasionally change so there will be gaps in the data.\nAdditionally, changes to search engine URL formats can cause problems with our data collection.\nSee\nthis query\nfor a notable example.\nAddon uptake\nThis probe is shipped as an addon.\nVersions 55 and greater have the addon installed by default\n(Bug).\nThe addon was deployed to older versions of Firefox via GoFaster,\nbut uptake is not 100%.\nLimited historical data\nThe addon was first deployed in 2017-06.\nThere is no tagged-* search data available before this.\n"},"datasets/mozetl/search_aggregates/reference.html":{"url":"datasets/mozetl/search_aggregates/reference.html","title":"Search Aggregates","keywords":"","body":"Search

A client has a row for a specific submission_date if\nthey were active at all in the 28 day window ending on that submission_date.\nA user is a \"heavy user\" as of day N if, for the 28 day period ending\non day N, the sum of their active_ticks is in the 90th percentile (or\nabove) of all clients during that period. For more analysis on this,\nand a discussion of new profiles, see\nthis link.\nBackground and Caveats\n\nData starts at 20170801. There is technically data in the table before\nthis, but the heavy_user column is NULL for those dates because it\nneeded to bootstrap the first 28 day window.\nBecause it is top the 10% of clients for each 28 day period, more\nthan 10% of clients active on a given submission_date will be\nconsidered heavy users. If you join with another data source\n(main_summary, for example), you may see a larger proportion of heavy\nusers than expected.\nEach day has a separate, but related, set of heavy users. Initial\ninvestigations show that approximately 97.5% of heavy users as of a\ncertain day are still considered heavy users as of the next day.\nThere is no \"fixing\" or weighting of new profiles - days before the\nprofile was created are counted as zero active_ticks. Analyses may\nneed to use the included profile_creation_date field to take this\ninto account.\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is available both via sql.t.m.o and Spark.\nIn Spark:\nspark.read.parquet(\"s3://telemetry-parquet/heavy_users/v1\")\n\nIn SQL:\nSELECT * FROM heavy_users LIMIT 3\n\nFurther Reading\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is\nhere\nData Reference\nExample Queries\nExample queries:\n\nJoin heavy_users with main_summary to get distribution of max_concurrent_tab_count for heavy vs. non-heavy users\nJoin heavy_users with longitudinal to get crash rates for heavy vs. non-heavy users\n\nScheduling\nThis dataset is updated daily via the telemetry-airflow infrastructure.\nThe job DAG runs every day after main_summary is complete.\nYou can find the job definition\nhere.\nSchema\nAs of 2017-10-05, the current version of the heavy_users dataset is v1, and has a schema as follows:\nroot\n |-- client_id: string (nullable = true)\n |-- sample_id: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- profile_creation_date: long (nullable = true)\n |-- active_ticks: long (nullable = true)\n |-- active_ticks_period: long (nullable = true)\n |-- heavy_user: boolean (nullable = true)\n |-- prev_year_heavy_user: boolean (nullable = true)\n |-- submission_date_s3: string (nullable = true)\nCode Reference\nThis dataset is generated by\ntelemetry-batch-view.\nRefer to this repository for information on how to run or augment the dataset.\n"},"meta/contributing.html":{"url":"meta/contributing.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nDocumentation is critical to making a usable data platform.\nWhen surveying our users,\ntheir most common complaint has been our lack of documentation.\nIt's important that we improve our documentation as often as possible.\nGetting the Raw Documentation\nThe documentation is intended to be read as HTML at\ndocs.telemetry.mozilla.org.\nHowever, we store the documentation in raw text files in the\nfirefox-data-docs repo.\nTo begin contributing to the docs, fork the firefox-data-docs repo.\nBuilding the Documentation\nThe documentation is rendered with GitBook\nTo build the documentation locally,\nyou'll need to install the gitbook-cli app with\nnpm:\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\n\nand install the GitBook plugins with:\ngitbook install\n\nYou can then serve the documentation locally with:\ngitbook serve\nThe complete documentation for the GitBook toolchain is at: https://toolchain.gitbook.com/.\nIf you run into any technical limitations, let me (@harterrt) know.\nI'm happy to change the tooling to make it as much fun as possible to write.\nAdding a new article\nBe sure to link to your new article from SUMMARY.md, or GitBook will not render the file.\nThe structure of the repository is outlined in this article.\nThis documentation is under active development,\nso we may already be working on the documentation you need.\nTake a look at\nthis bug component\nto check.\nStyle Guide\nArticles should be written in\nMarkdown\n(not AsciiDoc).\nMarkdown is usually powerful enough and is a more common technology than AsciiDoc.\nLimit lines to 100 characters where possible.\nTry to split lines at the end of sentences.\nThis makes it easier to reorganize your thoughts later.\nThis documentation is meant to be read digitally.\nKeep in mind that people read digital content much differently than other media.\nSpecifically, readers are going to skim your writing,\nso make it easy to identify important information.\nUse visual markup like bold text, code blocks, and section headers.\nAvoid long paragraphs.\nShort paragraphs that describe one concept each makes finding important information easier.\nSpell checking\nArticles should use proper spelling, and pull requests will be automatically checked for spelling\nerrors.\nTechnical articles often contain words that are not recognized by common dictionaries, if this\nhappens you may either put specialized terms in code blocks, or you may add an exception to\nthe .spelling file in the code repository.\nFor things like dataset names or field names, code blocks should be preferred.
